## Literature Review

Disney Dreamlight Valley’s new expansion pass A Rift In Time brings a whole new land that doubles the size of the game with animals, story, and more.




Disney Dreamlight Valley is launching out of early access and is celebrating its release by also debuting a new expansion pass A Rift In Time. This expansion to the game has much more content than any of the previously seen Dream Bundles, which only had a couple of quests and outfits. A Rift In Time appears to nearly double the size of the game by adding in an entirely new area consisting of three biomes, new resources, characters, and an involved story campaign that will take place over several chapters.
Although the A Rift In Time expansion pass does come atan additional cost of $29.99 USD, it makes sense given the magnitude of content that is said to be added to the game through it. The main narrative campaign for Disney Dreamlight Valley has been playable for the past year while it was in early access, leaving a need for the developers to provide a way to draw people back to the game who may have already completed the story of the Forgotten. A Rift In Time gives many new features and additions that both veteran players and those new to the game will be able to appreciate.

The Royal Toolbox is expanding in Disney Dreamlight Valley: A Rift In Time with a new Royal Hourglass that was created by an ancient civilization and has been guarded by EVE.

The magical Royal Hourglass will even provide the ability to craft new objects that have yet to be unveiled.





 2  New Disney Favorite Characters Are Added To The Game 
Gaston, Rapunzel, EVE, And Jafar


 







Each of the three new locations in the ​​​​​​​A Rift In Time expansion will be home to a new Disney friend.

Gaston is trapped away in the Glittering Dunes, and Rapunzel is happily enjoying the Wild Tangle. Meanwhile, Jafar is the main antagonist of the DLC, requiring help from the main character to fix the problems he has caused with the fabric of time.
