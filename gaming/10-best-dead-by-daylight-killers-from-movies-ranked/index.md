## Literature Review

Dead by Daylight features some of the horror genre&#39;s most iconic killers from the medium of movies. Though they are all terrifying, who is the best?




With the announcement of the soon-to-be-released Chucky Chapter for Dead by Daylight, and by extension the game&#39;s introduction of the malevolent Good Guy doll, Chucky, as a killer, the question emerges, just who is the best Dead by Daylight killer to have come from the medium of movies? Though there is a degree of subjectivity in the answer to this deadly conundrum, the game&#39;s inclusion of some of the most legendary and iconic horror movie antagonists means that no matter which killer is stalking the map, there is a pretty great chance that they have come prepared to leave no survivors.
Developed by Behaviour Interactive, and released in 2016, Dead by Daylight is an indie horror game in which an unstoppable Killer hunts down Survivors in a game of cat and mouse. Though this premise was outstanding before the introduction of iconic killers from the world of horror movies, their inclusion allows long-time lovers of the genre to live out their dream, or nightmare, of going toe-to-toe with the most deadly killers, creatures, and children&#39;s toys from cinema&#39;s most terrifying genre. An eclectic bunch, spanning gore core, slashers, and good old horror classics, Dead by Daylight&#39;s roster of killers is awesome.

 10  Pig (Amanda Young) - CHAPTER 7: The SAW Chapter 
Movies: Saw Franchise
        

First appearing as a minor character in 2004&#39;s Saw, before becoming a near-permanent fixture in the franchise, Amanda Young, joined the roster of killers in Dead by Daylight&#39;s seventh chapter, 2018&#39;s The Saw Chapter. Located in the Gideon Meat Plant Realm, Amanda, or &#34;The Pig,&#34; is a tormenting Killer with specialties that make her an expert in stealth attacks. This difficult-rated killer is the spiritual successor to the franchise&#39;s most iconic antagonist, Jigsaw (John Kramer); as a result, many of Amanda&#39;s powers and personal perks focus on Jigsaw&#39;s trademark tricks, traps, and choices - such as Amanda Young&#39;s three unique personal perks Make Your Choice, Surveillance, and, Scourge Hook: Hangman&#39;s Trick.
            
 
 Dead by Daylight&#39;s New Saw Crossover Reintroduces The Pig This Week 
Dead by Daylight&#39;s first fully licensed Tome, Tome 10, will revolve around a Saw crossover that brings The Pig back into the fold on January 26.








 9  Xenomorph - CHAPTER 29: Alien 
Movies: Alien and Alien Vs. Predator Franchise
        

The first Alien franchise movie, Alien, was released in 1979 and quickly became a classic of both the Sci-Fi and horror genres. Its legitimacy in both, was significantly aided by the inclusion of its terrifying antagonist, the endoparasitoid extraterrestrial, Xenomorph. Though this horror icon has made the leap to a number of games, arguably its best appearance came in Dead by Daylights Chapter 29: Alien. A moderately difficult adversary, the Xenomorph is vicious, agile, and cunning - a set of traits exemplified by Xenomorph&#39;s unique perks: Rapid Brutality, Alien instinct, and Ultimate Weapon - all of which can make surviving an encounter with this native of Xenomorph Prime a nightmare to face.





 8  Ghost Face (Danny Johnson) - CHAPTER 12: Ghost Face 
Movies: Scream Franchise
        

Though in the horror parody series, Scary Movie, Ghost Face is reduced to a joke, in the source material, Scream, Ghost Face is no laughing matter. This knife-wielding antagonist is stealthy, and methodical and takes a degree of sadistic glee in his brutal murders. Joining Dead by Daylights cast of killers in Chapter 12: Ghost Face, he is one of the hardest killers to come up against currently in the game. Adept at stalking and stealth, thanks to his power, Night Shroud, Ghost Face is one of the most formidable adversaries in the game. His victims may not see him coming, only hearing his Terror Radius Music and ominous breathing.





 7  Executioner (Pyramid Head) - CHAPTER 16: Silent Hill 
Movies: Silent Hill Franchise
        

Though the true origins of Pyramid Head came during the second installment of the Silent Hill video game franchise, Silent Hill 2, this masochistic manifestation of protagonist James Sunderland&#39;s guilt has been featured in movies - most notably the 2006 supernatural horror film, Silent Hill. Joining Dead by Daylight in Chapter 16: Silent Hill, Pyramid Head, known in-game as &#34;The Executioner,&#34; is a very hard killer to survive. Located in the Silent Hill Realm, Pyramid Head&#39;s abilities in-game are the stuff of nightmares. A sadistic and merciless executioner, Pyramid Head is obsessed with dispensing pain; its perks speak of its penchant for extraordinary brutality - Forced Penance, Trail of Torment, and Deathbound.





 6  Onyrō (Sadako Yamamura) - CHAPTER 23: Sadako Rising 
Movies: The Ring Franchise
        

Sadako Yamamura known in the game as &#34;The Onryō,&#34; is a killer in Dead by Daylight that originates in the 1991 horror novel, The Ring; however, her best-known appearance in the West came in the 2002 film of the same name. In the movie lore, Sadako Yamamura (known as Samara Morgan in the Western version) is the subject of an urban legend that states that anyone who watches a cursed videotape will die in seven days. Added in Chapter 23: Sadako Rising, a powerful and lethal onryō, Sadako Yamamura is an extremely difficult killer to evade, primarily as this vengeful ghost is able to silently and invisibly traverse the Realm.





 5  Cenobite (Elliot Spencer) - CHAPTER 21: Hellraiser 
Movies: Hellraiser Franchise
        

Originating as an unnamed figure in Clive Barker&#39;s 1986 novella, The Hellbound Heart, before going on to feature prominently in the classic 1987 horror movie Hellraiser, Pinhead, or &#34;The Cenobite,&#34; is the lead antagonist in the Hellraiser franchise. Introduced as a Killer in Chapter 21: Hellraiser, Pinhead specializes in inflicting map-wide suffering - this very hard killer can torture every survivor simultaneously, irrespective of their location. The Cenobite is a summoning Killer, with unique perks that allow him to torment Survivors. Possessing the perks Deadlock, Hex: Plaything, and Scourge Hook: Gift of Pain, taking on The Cenobite is not for the faint of heart or for those new to the game.





 4  The Shape (Michael Myers) - CHAPTER 2: The HALLOWEEN Chapter 
Movies: Halloween Franchise
       Artwork of The Shape from Dead by Daylight holding a bloody kitchen knife.   

Added to Dead by Daylight in 2016&#39;s Chapter 2: The HALLOWEEN Chapter, Michael Myers, known in the game as &#34;The Shape,&#34; is an icon of the horror movie genre. The primary antagonist in all but a few of the Halloween movies, Michael Myers is an almost indestructible killer who tends to be stealthy, stalking, and hunting his victims. Though only rated moderately difficult, Michael Myers is incredibly motivated; in Dead by Daylight, the longer The Shape stalks his victims, the stronger and faster he becomes. Survivors must act fast if they are to avoid falling victim to his deadly blade.





 3  Cannibal (Bubba Sawyer) - CHAPTER 5.5: LEATHERFACE 
Movies: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Franchise


 







Quite possibly the most iconic antagonist from any slasher horror movie, Bubba Sawyer, known as &#34;The Cannibal&#34; in Dead by Daylight, is the primary threat in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre franchise of films. Better known to fans of the classic horror series as Leatherface, The Cannibal was added to the roster in Chapter 5.5: Leatherface. Although only moderately difficult, The Cannibal is a chainsaw-wielding killer with the power, Bubba&#39;s Chainsaw, which allows him to trigger a dangerous frenzy. Visually terrifying, and incredibly difficult to escape from, The Cannibal&#39;s murderous motivations are unique, not a sadist, nor selfish. The Cannibal kills his victims out of fear - and perhaps out of hunger.





 2  Nightmare (Freddy Krueger) - CHAPTER 6: A Nightmare on Elm Street 
Movies: A Nightmare On Elm Street Franchise


 







Freddy Krueger is said to be the &#34;Bastard Son of 100 Maniacs,&#34; this dream-waving adversary from the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise is the malevolent spirit of a child killer who was burned to death by his victims&#39; parents. Introduced to Dead by Daylight in Chapter 6: A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Nightmare, as he is known in the game, is terrifying. Located in the Springwood Realm, The Nightmare, as his name may suggest, pulls Survivors into his Dream World, where they are incredibly vulnerable. Furthermore, he has the Dream Projection ability, which allows him to suddenly appear anywhere around the map. When facing Kruger, nowhere is safe.





 1  Chucky (Charles Lee Ray) - CHAPTER 30: Chucky Chapter 
Movies: Child&#39;s Play Franchise


 







Announced as the next killer to be added to the game in Fall 2023, Chucky, one of the most malevolent figures in movies, is a perfect fit for Dead by Daylight. The primary antagonist of the Child&#39;s Play series, Chucky is a Good Guy doll gone bad. Corrupted by the soul of a vicious serial killer named Charles Lee Ray, during the first movie, 1988&#39;s Child&#39;s Play, Chucky has gone on to undoubtedly become one of the most famed and feared horror icons of cinema. Despite his diminutive stature, side-splittingly funny dialogue, and highly customizable outfit options, players should not underestimate the power and determination of this infamous killer doll.
Featuring new lines of dialogue voiced by Chucky’s original voice actor Brad Dourif, the Dead by Daylight: Chucky Chapter, is bound to be unlike anything Survivors have experienced before. Beyond this, players will have the option to customize Chucky&#39;s outfit. Though there are a number of excellent and deeply terrifying options, an especially excellent outfit is the Good Gal outfit. Inspired by Tiffany Valentine, also known as the Bride of Chucky, this outfit not only changes this little killer&#39;s appearance but also their voice actor. While wearing the Good Gal outfit in Dead by Daylight, this plastic predator will be voiced by the one-and-only voice of Tiffany Valentine, Jennifer Tilly.
The Dead by Daylight: Chucky Chapter will be available on all supported platforms on November 28.
