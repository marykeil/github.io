## Literature Review

Lethal Company is full of dangerous and mysterious entities determined to take your scrap and your life. Luckily, each entity has its weakness.





Entities in Lethal Company fall into one of two categories. Some spawn inside the moon&#39;s main building, roaming the halls but unable to leave (except for Ghost Girl and Masked entities). Others appear in the wilds outside the facility. Each can throw a wrench into your scavenging, so you must be clever to get your scrap and meet your quota.




                  Is Lethal Company On PS5 Or Xbox Consoles?   Lethal Company is a smash indie hit on Steam, connecting friends together to investigate dank &amp; creepy corridors, but is it currently on PS5 or Xbox?   


 Indoor Entities &amp; Their Weaknesses 
         

Most indoor entities can open doors inside the facility but can&#39;t open the main door or fire exits. Ghost Girl (who can appear near the ship) and the Masked (likely due to their penchant for mimicking player behavior) are exceptions. The facility contains twelve of the nineteen entities in Lethal Company as of Version 45. Almost all can be shocked with a stun grenade or zap gun, save for the Ghost Girl. Seven can be killed with weapons like the shovel or the Nutcracker&#39;s shotgun, but this is easier said than done for some.






Hygrodere are the only entities that cannot open interior doors.




When exploring a dangerous moon, one of the best strategies you can implement for handling the entities inside the facility is to have one player equip a shovel or stop sign while the other prepares a zap gun for the larger and tougher enemies. Each entity has a unique strategy for handling it, ranging from avoidance to combat to running as fast as possible.

                  10 Lootable Lethal Company Scrap Items, Ranked By Usefulness   There are a ton of different scrap loot items found in the horror indie Lethal Company, but not all of the items are valuable or useful.    

 Entity  Appearance  Health  Weaknesses &amp; Strategies   Bracken  A shadowy creature with multiple protrusions on its back and small white eyes.  5  Quickly glance at the entity to scare it away, but do not stare at it for longer than a few seconds, or it will become aggressive.   Bunker Spider  A large brown spider (will appear as floating text that says &#34;spider&#34; is arachnophobia mode is on).  5  Avoid touching spider webs inside the facility or getting too close to a patrolling entity.   Coil-Head  An old mannequin with a large spring for a neck.  Invulnerable  Coil-Heads cannot move when they are looked at. Work with another player so there is always someone watching the entity. If the entity needs to be repositioned to allow for escape, quickly look away and look back.   Ghost Girl  A pale girl with brown hair and a red dress, only visible to the player she is haunting.  Invulnerable  Avoid turning around when you hear giggling or breathing, and the Ghost Girl will eventually despawn. Other signs that you are being haunted include audio distortions, flickering lights, and the sound of a grandfather clock.   Hoarding Bug  A four-legged brown bug with small wings and big red eyes.  2  Do not interfere with Hoarding Bugs as they steal and horde scrap. Keep your distance and, if necessary, offer them an item to steal. Otherwise, they are easy to kill with two hits from a shovel or sign.   Hygrodere  A blob of teal slime.  Invulnerable  Hop on railings to cross over paths it has consumed. You can also trap it behind doors throughout the facility.   






 Entity  Appearance  Health  Weaknesses &amp; Strategies   Jester  A jack-in-the-box with a pair of legs and one arm to spin the handle.  Invulnerable  When the entity begins winding its handle, everyone must evacuate the facility before it pops and begins to chase you at increasing speeds. Wait about 10 seconds before entering the building again.   Masked  A Company employee with a dramatic mask attached to their face.  4  Unless you are on Rend or Titan, this entity will not appear if all employees avoid picking up masks found in the facility or wearing them.   Nutcracker  A large but traditionally styled nutcracker is wielding a shotgun.  5  Approach the entity from behind when its head pops up, and a large eye stalk scans the area. Hit the eye until the entity perishes.   Snare Flea  A large pink bug that hangs from the ceiling and attaches to player&#39;s faces.  3  Check the ceiling for Snare Fleas, especially on Assurance, Experimentation, and Vow, and avoid those areas. If a Snare Flea attaches to a friend&#39;s face, hit their face with a shovel or sign until the entity falls off.   Spore Lizard  A crocodile/alligator with a large, round, gaping mouth rather than a head and a purple ball on the end of its tail.  Immune  The Spore Lizard is less dangerous than it appears to be, as it can only distort vision with a puff of smoke.   Thumper  A two-legged mount of flesh with four mouths forming a flower-like shape.  4  Team up with another player to distract the entity while the other hits it with a shovel or sign. You also have a chance to attack when the entity first sees you.   



                  Lethal Company: How to Disable Turrets   In Lethal Company players are always in danger and there are no safe places to hide, so they should disable dangers like turrets when possible.   



 Outdoor Entities &amp; Their Weaknesses 
         




Outdoor entities in Lethal Company are either relatively harmless critters or deadly and difficult-to-attack monsters. Although only seven entities can spawn outside, these creatures can come right up to your ship, sometimes even entering it. In some ways, they are easier to avoid due to the size of the exterior map, but they are some of the most keenly sensitive entities and, therefore, are primed to attack.

                  Lethal Company: How to Escape From Jeb   One of the most unique monsters you can encounter in Lethal Company is Jeb, a tentacled beast who you can escape from if you stay careful around it.   



Four of the seven outdoor entities can be shocked with zap guns or stun grenades: Baboon Hawks, Forest Keepers, Eyeless Dogs, and Manticoils.




 Entity  Appearance  Health  Weaknesses &amp; Strategies   Baboon Hawk  A green creature with stubby legs, thick bat wings, a crocodile-like face, and round red eyes.  6  Stay in large groups to intimidate the Baboon Hawks and shout at them through the in-game microphone.   Circuit Bee  Rectangular insects with bee wings that conduct electricity between each other.  Invulnerable  The Circuit Bees will largely ignore you unless you want to collect their beehive. If so, grab it quickly and run to the ship as fast as you can.   Earth Leviathan  A giant worm that launches out from underground.  Invulnerable  When black particles rise out of the ground, immediately drop any heavy objects you&#39;re carrying and sprint as fast as you can out of the area.   Eyeless Dog  A red, dog-like body with a huge mouth containing spear-like teeth.  12  Stay quiet when they&#39;re nearby, as they rely on sound over sight. Use loud objects like the boombox to lure them away. If they roar and charge, dodge out of their path.   Forest Keeper  A giant lacking a head but covered in eye-like growths with a big black hole for a mouth.  Invulnerable  Keep out of the entity&#39;s line of sight and sneak around it as it wanders the moon.   Manticoil  A yellow bird with purple-tipped wings.  1  Manticoils are harmless entities and will not attack you.   Roaming Locust  A humming swarm of bugs.  Invulnerable  Roaming Locusts are not harmful and can be dispersed with a flashlight.   






Each of the nineteen entities in Lethal Company provides life and danger to the moons, reminding you of how little The Company cares for your life. If you can recognize each entity as you spot it, you may just live to collect scrap another day.
