## Literature Review

Jinx is a side quest challenge in Super Mario RPG Remake. If you can best him several times he yields an impressive physical accessory, the Jinx Belt.





Jinx can be challenged any time after meeting him. There is no pressure to defeat him consecutively. If your level is too low, consider returning later in the game once you gain more abilities among all companions in Super Mario RPG Remake.




                  Super Mario RPG’s Hidden Boss Explained   Super Mario RPG actually includes a secret superboss, and a powered-up version who can only be fought after beating the game. Here’s how to find them.   


 Jagger The Student 
          

Encountering Jinx is fully optional in Super Mario RPG Remake. However, some breadcrumbs are left during the main storyline. After fully clearing out the Belome Temple dungeon, you will gain access to the mountain settlement of Monstro Town. Enter the local dojo to find Jagger, Bowser’s former guard. He will state that he has become the pupil of Jinx and will be the first obstacle to gaining an audience with his master.

Jagger is a fairly standard Terrapin enemy, highly encountered earlier in the game. He has a respectable 600 HP and good defenses. However, he has little protection against magic. This makes him rather susceptible to attacks from Mallow, Geno, or Peach. Jagger almost exclusively uses Terrapunch to attack. This move will likely only deal 10-40 damage, depending on which character is hit. For the most part, Jagger should fall quickly and allow you to meet Jinx.






 Challenging Master Jinx 
          

As soon as Jagger is bested, Jinx will now appear. He is much more powerful than his student in Super Mario RPG Remake, so you must be prepared. A minimum level of 18 is recommended for the best attacks, but even going up to level 20 is even more secure. Geno is the best source of buffing and damage for the fight, while Peach will help keep the team alive. Just like the original release, Mario is a required fighter, so he can still be used to deliver some damage.

First Round
This is Jinx’s easiest form, almost a hustle for how powerful he is. He only has 600 hitpoints, a relatively low amount of damage output. He should only deal around 20 or so damage to Geno and Peach and might even do zero to Mario. Pummel him quickly with Geno Beam and Super Jump for consistent damage. Peach can use regular attacks and possibly won’t even need to heal.




Second Round
The rematch with Jinx is a bit harder, but it still should be beatable on the first try. He will increase his hit points to 800 and have more attack, defense, magic defense, and speed. He also gains two new attacks: Quicksilver and Silver Bullet. The former deals double damage, and the latter is instant death. However, both attacks can be nullified with a timed block or by naturally evading.



The previous ability usage strategy should remain mostly the same, but now, be careful always to block to avoid extra damage. Geno should use Geno Boost for both attack and defense bonuses. Peach should use Therapy and Come Back as needed to survive.




Third Round
The final encounter is when Jinx fully shows off his power in Super Mario RPG Remake. He has an impressive 1,000 hit points and even more damage, defense, and speed. His ultimate attack is Bombs Away, which does quadruple damage to one target. This is enough to one-shot most of the party, including the tough-as-nails Bowser if you switch him in.

Peach needs to be on extreme healing and revival duty the whole fight. If the princess herself falls, Mario should get her up while Geno does the bulk of the damage. After beating him, Jinx will hand over the Jinx Belt. This will increase attack power, physical defense, and speed by a good amount. The belt is also worth 800 coins, which can be a fair amount of money mid-way through the campaign.






 Post-Game Rematch 
          

While three rounds are the standard conclusion, more challenges can be unlocked after fully completing Super Mario RPG Remake​​​​​​​&#39;s story. This includes defeating even the final boss, Smithy. After doing so, there will be a prompt to save and enter Post-Game mode. Return to Monstro Town and enter the dojo. Since the last encounter, Jinx has studied Mario’s jumps and the use of Triple Moves. He will request you show off your true powers.



It is highly recommended that you reach a minimum level of 25, but higher levels are even better. Geno will still be the primary character for attacking and protection. However, survival is even more important, making Bowser an even better option to switch to. While he is typically considered the worst party member, his high defenses will help in this final battle with Jinx.




Fourth Round
Jinx will be even tougher than last time, with nearly 4,000 hitpoints, increased damage, defense, and evasion. He will also frequently use Quicksilver, Silver Bullet, and Bombs Away. If the inputs are timed correctly, Geno Boost will be a great way of guarding against these attacks; an incorrect input will only raise a character&#39;s offense. However, Jinx only needs to witness a single Triple Move, including defensive ones like Spare Us All and Healing Rainbow.




Jinx will reduce the Action Gauge to zero percent to make things a bit harder. This means there is no way to cheat the fight by building up the meter and using a Triple Move as your first action. Instead, you must carefully time all your blocks and hits to reach 100%.



Multi-input moves like Mario’s Super Jump, Geno’s Geno Whirl, and Mallow’s Star Rain will quickly fill the Action Gauge back up. However, missing an attack is even worse. You should still rely on moves you are personally comfortable hitting all beats of the ability’s rhythm.




After unleashing a Triple Move, Jinx will collapse in disbelief. As a reward, he will grant the Teamwork Band accessory. This will significantly quicken how fast the Action Gauge fills during combat, allowing the use of different moves. This item is excellent for fighting other enemies, like the Culex hidden boss fight. There are other rematch battles in the Super Mario RPG Remake, and using many Triple Moves can be a good means of winning them.
