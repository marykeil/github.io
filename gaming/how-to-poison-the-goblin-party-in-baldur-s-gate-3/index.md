## Literature Review

There are many ways to approach each encounter in Baldur&#39;s Gate III, for instance, at the Goblin Camp players can poison them instead of fighting.





Unless you&#39;re completing an evil playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, destroying the Goblin Camp is the best choice, and there are many different ways to do this. A brute force frontal attack is just one possible approach. However, there are also ways to sneak or talk your way into the camp, using skills such as Persuasion, Deception, or Intimidation, to launch a surprise attack.





 How To Poison The Goblin Camp in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

Before entering the inner temple proper, you should spot a large campfire that the goblins are using to roast some meat. Off to the side is a Booze Tub (X: -99 Y:442). To poison the Goblin Camp, you&#39;ll have to click on the Tub and add Basic Poison, Wyvern Toxin, or Drow Poison.



You can obtain Wyvern Toxin by speaking to Healer Nettie at the Emerald Grove. Basic Poison is also often dropped by various enemies.




The Goblins will challenge you if they spot you trying to put poison in their booze. Your chosen party member will have a few dialogue options to avoid combat. This includes Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion via Illithid powers, or Detect Thoughts. These options are generally best suited for characters with high Charisma, such as Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Bards.




However, failing these skill checks will start a fight, so the best approach is to poison the Booze Tub while Invisible. There are a few ways to disappear, including potions or spells. Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, and Wizards can all learn the Invisibility spell as early as Level 3. Characters who can&#39;t cast spells can purchase Potions of Invisibility. These are sold by many traders in Act One, including Auntie Ethel at the Druid Grove and Roah Moonglow at the Shattered Sanctum.



You may have already had some trouble with Auntie Ethel before reaching the Goblin Camp, so try and buy everything useful from her when you first meet.




After adding the poison, a cutscene will trigger as the Goblins get more drinks from the Booze Tub. One of them will ask why you&#39;re not joining their celebratory drinks, and you&#39;ll have the option to lead a toast to the Goblins&#39; success in order to blend in. After this, your character can:




  Spill their drink, but pretend to take a sip (Pass a Sleight of Hand 10 Check)   Say it would be rude to drink before their hosts (Pass a Deception 10 Check)   Drink the poison. However, you can pass a Constitution 15 Check to avoid receiving the Poisoned debuff.  

There&#39;s also a simpler solution: take a drink and follow up with a bottle of Antidote.



 What To Do After Poisoning The Goblin Camp In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
          

After the toast, the rest of the Goblins will drink. Several Goblins will die instantly, while others will suffer reduced health. However, not all of them will be affected. The Goblins will quickly accuse your group of poisoning them. You can confess straight away, triggering a fight or:

  Convince them that you wouldn&#39;t still be here if you had poisoned them (Pass a Deception 15 check)   Use Detect Thoughts and pass an Intelligence 12 Check to convince them they&#39;re allergic.   Intimidate them into backing down (Pass an Intimidation 10 Check)  






If you&#39;re playing as the Dark Urge in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, poisoning the Goblin Camp will earn you an Inspiration point.




If you pass the checks, the Goblins will end their party, destroy the Booze Tub, and go on high alert. If you fail, your party will need to kill the remaining Goblins. This is still one of the toughest early fights in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 due to the sheer number of enemies. However, poisoning the Goblin Camp gives you a decisive advantage that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.
