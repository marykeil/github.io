## Literature Review

Raging Bolt is a new Paradox Pokémon introduced with the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet. Here’s how to unlock it and Raging Bolt’s location.





In fact, Area Zero itself is getting a few new Paradox Pokémon for you to hunt. One such creature is Raging Bolt. This is the ancient Paradox form of Raikou, the Legendary Electric-type from Generation 2. Raging Bolt is part of the same unnamed group as Walking Wake, which is Suicune’s ancient Paradox version. Raging Bolt retains Raikou’s Electric-type, but gains a second type and sees a drastic change to its design, notable due to its elongated neck that resembles that of a brontosaurus. The creature is one of the many that compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC, so catching it is required for completion.

 How To Unlock Raging Bolt In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
         

In order to unlock Raging Bolt’s encounter in the Indigo Disk DLC for Scarlet and Violet, you will first need to initiate the expansion and head on over to Blueberry Academy. Once you reach the inside of the Terarium by taking the elevator down, you will see a familiar face: Perrin. This NPC first appeared in the Land of Kitakami during the events of the previous DLC and is the one responsible for guiding you toward the capture of Bloodmoon Ursaluna in the Pokémon Teal Mask DLC. Perrin is located near the entrance to the Terarium and the first order of business is interacting with her.




The NPC will be happy to see you and will say that she has a “hint” to share, but can only do so once you register 200 Pokémon in the Blueberry Pokédex. You will need to head further into the Terarium, catch, evolve, and trade version-exclusive Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC until you register 200 creatures.

Once that task is done, you can return to Perrin. She will then reveal the hint she has been keeping. There are two photographs. One is of Gouging Fire, the ancient Paradox form of Entei. The second picture is of Raging Bolt, your ultimate target in this endgame side quest.



Gouging Fire and Raging Bolt will only appear if your version of the game is Pokémon Scarlet. In case you are playing Pokémon Violet, the creatures that will appear in the photos and in the game are Iron Boulder and Iron Crown in Pokémon Indigo Disk. To fully complete your Blueberry Pokédex, you will be required to trade these Paradox Pokémon.






 Where To Find Raging Bolt In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC (Raging Bolt’s Location) 
          




Although Perrin mentions she does not know where the picture of Raging Bolt was taken, you should know by now that the creature resides in Paldea’s Area Zero, also known as the Great Crater of Paldea. Raging Bolt is given the Legendary treatment and has a fixed spawn location. This means players need to find the Pokémon and interact with it to initiate the encounter.

To reach Raging Bolt’s location in Pokémon Indigo Disk, you will start off from the initial zone in Area Zero and move forward until you reach the ledge. From there, use your Koraidon mount to jump and glide (or fly), then move to the left.



If you try to find Raging Bolt before Perrin’s “hint”, you will fail. You are required to complete her 200 Pokédex entries side quest.




While you are in the air, you will see a thin and large waterfall immediately to your left, dropping from the cliff wall you just jumped off from. Head toward the water and plummet through the hole in the ground that the water goes through. Once you hit the bottom, you should be able to see Raging Bolt in that area, standing tall with its long neck. Do not forget to save the game before interacting with Raging Bolt. This will allow you to hard reset the software in case you knock out or ultimately fail to catch Raging Bolt in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.






 Tips To Catch Raging Bolt In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          

In case you do not want to utilize the free Master Ball in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, which you either obtained through the campaign or through the limited-time Mystery Gift distribution event, you can start the encounter by throwing a Quick Ball at Raging Bolt. This Poké Ball has a fairly good catch rate when utilized in the very first round of any encounter, so you may just get lucky enough to beat the odds and catch the new Paradox Pokémon in the Indigo Disk DLC without much trouble. If Raging Bolt does not stay inside, you need to use the traditional method for catching Legendaries.



Only use Quick Ball if you are comfortable with its appearance. Many Trainers often use more elegant-looking Poké Balls, such as the Luxury Ball or Premier Ball, for creatures that are hard to obtain.







This consists of lowering its HP bar to the red zone and, hopefully, applying some status effect on it, like Sleep or Paralyze. Burn and Poison can increase your catch rate, but they deal damage against the opponent every round, which puts your mission of catching Raging Bolt at stake since it can faint due to its recurrent injuries.

It is important to know that Raging Bolt is a dual Electric- and Dragon-type Pokémon. This means that it is weak against Ground-, Ice-, Dragon-, and Fairy-type attacks. In direct opposition, Raging Bolt is resistant to Flying-, Steel-, Fire-, Water-, Grass-, and Electric-type moves in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC.

If you are using a super-effective move to try to lower Raging Bolt’s HP to a satisfactory catching leveling, be careful to not knock it out. If you are playing it safe by striking it with moves that are not very effective, consider a resistant team, as this process may take a while. Raging Bolt is encountered at level 75.

It is not an extremely difficult catch, but any Pokémon with a Legendary treatment should make you have some caution when facing them. Raging Bolt is one of the several new additions in the Indigo Disk DLC, which also includes Dipplin’s evolution Hydrapple in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
