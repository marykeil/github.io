## Literature Review

Katanas are fun, incredibly powerful melee weapons to wield in Cyberpunk 2077. Here is how to get the best and coolest swords to swing in the game.





There are Standard and Iconic versions of katanas that you can find around Night City, with each having blades of both Epic and Legendary rarity that determine their strength. Some of these are gifted to you for completing quests, while others are hidden around areas of the world. A few can even be crafted if your build has a few skill points dedicated to Technical Ability as you level up in Cyberpunk 2077.
A Katana is best used when your build focuses on the Reflex, Body, and Cool Attributes. These will increase your overall Health, Crit Chance, Crit Damage, Damage Mitigation, and Movement Speed to support many different strategies. 

 : Cyberpunk 2077: The Best Unique Melee Weapons (&amp; Where to Find Them)









 








 10  Standard Katana 
Old Reliable


 







This basic Katana may not have any unique abilities or mods, but it is still a reliable weapon that has more flexibility than other swords on this list. When you have enough Technical Ability, you can craft higher-rarity versions of this blade. Fully upgrading this katana also lets you apply Aspects, which let you apply elemental effects in Cyberpunk 2077, including Thermal, Chemical, or even Electrical properties.
A Legendary Standard Katana can actually be bought from the NPC Coach Fred, who is found in Little China within Megabuilding H10. 






 9  Black Unicorn 
Toss a Coin
        

The Black Unicorn is a fun reference to The Witcher series, with this sword sporting runes that Geralt would use etched into the blade. A steel katana made to cut down humans, this weapon has a ton of Armor Penetration and Bleeding Chance to dismantle enemy defenses. You can get Black Unicorn put instantly into V&#39;s stash by linking your GOG account to Cyberpunk 2077 or owning a version of the game on GOG Galaxy.





 8  Tsumetogi 
Electric Feel
        

The Tsumetogi focuses on applying Electrical damage with every swing, applying 20% Shock on enemies every time you manage to hit them in Cyberpunk 2077. Received during the &#34;Pisces Side Job&#34; mission with the NPC Judy, this blade is an early Iconic katana you can find. As you end up fighting machines and robots throughout the game, this sword can be an excellent tool against this kind of foe.





 7  Gwynbleidd 
Blade of a Witcher


 







Gwynbleidd is an upgrade from the Black Unicorn katana that is available in the Phantom Liberty DLC for Cyberpunk 2077. A direct reference to the sword Geralt wields in The Witcher series, this blade is found in the Electric Corporation Power Plant during the &#34;Disasterpiece&#34; main quest from the expanded content. This weapon has two major effects, with one being a simple ability to deal more damage to bosses.
The other trait for Gwynbleidd comes after you kill enemies in rapid succession. When you do this, all attacks are temporarily guaranteed to be Crit Hits, with this effect recharging quickly if you keep taking down foes. If you happen to be low on health, this Iconic Katana modifier will become active regardless of the number of enemies you eliminate back to back in Cyberpunk 2077.





 6  Cocktail Stick 
Bring the Party to Them
        

The bright pink blade known as the Cocktail Stick is rewarded as you continue the &#34;Automatic Love&#34; side quest in the Clouds area. This weapon is tied to Evelyn Parker, and can be found in their dressing room during the mentioned mission in Cyberpunk 2077. Human enemies are torn apart by this sword since it has an increased 300% Dismemberment stat, an ability that cleaves into your opponents for huge damage.





 5  Scalpel 
Surgical Precision
        

Another katana that emphasizes Electrical damage, the Scalpel sword is a direct upgrade to the Tsumetogi, with new traits beyond applying Shock. With only a 10% chance to inflict Shock, the real ability of this weapon is a 50% Crit Chance on all your attacks. When combined with the Sandevistan cyberware in Cyberpunk 2077, you also gain a 100% Bleed chance on your strikes, draining enemies of their life quickly.
The Scalpel can be found as a reward for completing the &#34;Big in Japan&#34; Side Job that you can pick up within Night City. 






 4  Satori 
Sharp Steel of the Past
        

Emperor Saburo Arasaka&#39;s personal sword, Satori, can be grabbed in &#34;The Heist&#34; mission, and has an astonishing 500% Crit Damage trait. This makes it deal some of the highest damage in Cyberpunk 2077, despite a 20% less base damage side effect that reflects the weapon&#39;s age. When combined with the right Perks and Mods, you should be able to bring out the full potential of this 20th-century blade.
When you&#39;re trying to get Satori in &#34;The Heist,&#34; you&#39;ll have to go to the roof after the character T-BUG tells you to leave the room. Instead of heading through the door, climb up the stairs and take out the guards to find the sword in the Arasaka vehicle. 






 3  Errata 
Red-Hot Liberty


 







The Errata is one of the most popular swords introduced in the Phantom Liberty DLC, due to its ability to burn enemies after a few attacks. You can lunge forward with this Thermal Katana in Cyberpunk 2077, igniting your foes on fire to gradually drain their health. This incredibly flashy blade is obtained when you search for the Forge within the Electric Corporation Power Plant in the &#34;Disasterpiece&#34; mission.
Attacking any burning enemy with Errata deals automatic Crit Damage, making it a weapon that deals elemental strikes and high attack numbers in equal measure. Builds for V in Cyberpunk 2077 that focus on Body more than Reflex are especially suited to this blade, since they can charge into battle with increased health to apply the burning effect.





 2  Jinchu-Maru 
Fury of the Underdog
        

One of the strongest katanas in Cyberpunk 2077 is the Jinchu-Maru, a blade that&#39;s obtained by defeating Sandayu Oda in the &#34;Play it Safe&#34; main story mission. Similar to the Scalpel, this sword has a built-in modifier when you use a specific type of cyberware, the Kerenzikov. This equipment is a Nervous System that lets you briefly slow down time when blocking, aiming, or attacking during a slide or dodge.
When you activate Kerenzikov, you gain a 100% Crit Chance with Jinchu-Maru, giving you a great chance to deal extra damage in dangerous situations. This katana also deals double damage to enemies with twice the user&#39;s current Health. With the last hit of an attack combo with this blade dealing double damage as well, this makes the weapon perfect for boss battles throughout Cyberpunk 2077.





 1  Byakko 
Refined Professional
        

The Iconic Byakko katana in Cyberpunk 2077 is owned by Wakako Okada, and is by far one of the best weapons in the game. This blade has an ability that increases your melee range by 1 meter, and allows you to leap from one enemy to another. You can get this sword by completing the &#34;Professional Widow&#34; side quest for Okada, where it will be added to V&#39;s personal stash for you to pair with your character build.
While the Jinchu-Maru may seem stronger at first, the Perks and Skills you acquire later in Cyberpunk 2077 make Byakko even stronger by comparison. You gain a 15% increased chance to apply Bleeding to enemies every time you attack, letting you take out most opponents in a couple of swings or less. This stylish weapon has the raw power to take out basic enemies and bosses alike when used correctly.
Feel free to watch YouTube creator Sam Brash&#39;s visual list of the strengths and weaknesses of each katana in the game to learn even more about these sharp swords. While not everyone will dedicate themselves to the best katanas in Cyberpunk 2077, they are still a fun option that is integral to the world of Night City.
