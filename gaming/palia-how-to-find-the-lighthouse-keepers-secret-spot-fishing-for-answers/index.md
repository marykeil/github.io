## Literature Review

One of the quests you can find in Palia is &#34;Fishing for Answers,&#34; which asks you to find the secret spot of The Lighthouse Keeper for rare rewards.





The &#34;Fishing for Answers&#34; quest only begins when you reach the Lighthouse, which is located in Bahari Bay on a series of cliffs towards the eastern part of the area. Using the Pulsewater Plains Stable Point as a fast travel spot will let you travel to the Lighthouse quickly. Thankfully, the large structure near the beach will be a little easier to discover than the Old Coin artifacts in Palia scattered across the map.




                  7 Things to Know Before Playing Palia   Players just starting out in Palia will benefit from knowing a few key tips and tricks before fully diving into this cozy open-world MMO adventure.   


 How to Start the &#34;Fishing for Answers&#34; Quest 
          

Entering the Lighthouse will let you pick up the Lightkeeper&#39;s diary item on the structure&#39;s first floor in Palia. The book will be on a table with a chair propped up next to it, and will have a couple of bottles resting on the furniture as well. Interacting with the diary gives you a prompt to read the book, which introduces you to the former Lighthouse Keeper, Faadhil.

The book talks about Jabarii, or a man that Faadhil had a great love for for many years at the Lighthouse. Unfortunately, Jabarii left at some point, and caused Faadhil to become greatly depressed at his departure. The Lighthouse Keeper would send out messages in a bottle out into the sea, with the hope that they would eventually reach Jabarii wherever he could be.




Reading this diary entry begins the &#34;Fishing for Answers&#34; quest, which asks you to find Faadhil&#39;s letters out in the ocean near the Lighthouse itself. Similar to finding and catching Eyeless Minnow fish, you&#39;ll need to cast in specific areas to pull up the bottles Faahil had thrown into the water. Head to the docks right below the Lighthouse to get started on the second step of the quest.



 Where to Fish for Faadhil&#39;s Letters 
          

After traveling down from the Lighthouse, you must go to the right side of the docks where the vertical and horizontal paths intersect before you start fishing. This is the perfect place to start reeling in Faadhil&#39;s bottled messages, which cannot be found anywhere else along the shore. Palia&#39;s fishing system is easy enough to understand if you have already gone through most of the game&#39;s tutorials.






Make sure to fish without bait in the right spot below the Lighthouse, or else you will constantly attract fish to your line instead of the bottles whose messages you need to read for the quest.




There are three letters you need to pick up from fishing, and read all the way through to get the right clues for the quest. The final note will describe another place on the map where both Jabarii and Faadhil would spend time together in Palia. This &#34;secret spot&#34; becomes the final part of the quest, and can be difficult to track down if you aren&#39;t paying attention to the clues from each message.



 The Lighthouse Keeper&#39;s Secret Spot Location 
          

The Lighthouse Keeper&#39;s Secret Spot is near Lighthouse Lagoon, or within an area that has a view of both the entire bay and the aqueduct in Palia. Travel north to where your map indicates the quest, and look around the large area indicated by the quest tracker. You should look for the wall between both parts of Bahari Bay, which has a unique structure that has the view you&#39;re looking for.




A small tree with orange leaves should be visible at the top of a small hill formed from a bunch of rocks in this place. Climbing up or gliding to this spot from far away will reveal a small patch of dirt on top of the natural formation in Palia. The prompt for interacting with this patch shows that a Former Lighthouse Keeper&#39;s Letter is found here, and represents perhaps the last message from Faadhil to Jabarii.

Surprisingly, this letter is actually from Jabarii this time, and details an apology to Faadhil for not responding to all the previous letters you found fishing earlier. Jabarii is traveling to Akwinduu now in search of Faadhil, which wraps up this love story with a hopeful ending. However, Jabarii also left the former Lighthouse Keeper an Apology Gift in the dirt that you can pick up for some rare rewards.

                  7 Best Crops To Grow In Palia   Though there are several crops to grow in Palia for a variety of reasons, players need to determine which ones are best for their gardens.   






 Gift of Apology Rewards 
          

Opening the Gift of Apology from this quest rewards you with a Box of Chocolates, the Lighthouse Keeper&#39;s Ring, and a Heartdrop Lily. The Box of Chocolates is an important quest item that can be gifted to a romanceable NPC whose Friendship Level is 3 or higher. Doing this in Palia will unlock their romance questline, and give you a new &#34;Flirt&#34; dialogue option with the character for the rest of the game.

The Ring can be sold for 300 Gold, but holds no purpose other than being worth a bit of money and having some sentimental value for the two lovers. The Heartdrop Lily is an extremely rare flower that is usually only found in Bahari Bay along the hills of the Statue Garden. This plant holds the same purpose as the Box of Chocolates, and lets you romance your favorite NPC in Palia.






Heartdrop Lilys may also be purchased from the Foraging Guild Store, but they cost 20 Palia Coins, which are a secondary in-game currency you have to purchase with real-world money.




Those who find the Lighthouse Keeper&#39;s Secret Spot in Palia will have great items to transform their relationships with certain characters, which reflects the story behind the &#34;Fishing for Answers&#34; quest.
