## Literature Review

The newest Wordle word is up and ready to be played. We&#39;ve got everything you need to solve the December 27th answer.





If a more difficult challenge is needed for your daily fix there is always Wordle&#39;s Hard Mode which can be accessed through the options menu in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Using this mode requires you to use the hints given previously on any subsequent answer. This locks out the classic strategy of just using different word combos to see a large number of letter clues in a small amount of guesses.

Before we fully spoil today&#39;s Wordle answer we wanted to provide a few hints to help out anyone who may just need a little push in the right direction.

 Hint 1  There are no repeating letters.   Hint 2  The answer is used as a noun.   Hint 3  This word uses the &#34;sometimes vowel&#34;.   Hint 4  A flower with a yellow disk &amp; white rays.

The December 27th Wordle answer is DAISY.

For our starting Wordle word today we used IRATE which provided two major vowels in the wrong positions. Getting the vowels early in any game of Wordle is imperative to the rest of the daily solving. Moving forward we tried PAINS as our second guess. This locked in both those vowels and added an incorrectly placed &#39;S&#39;.

After a little deliberation, we quickly figured out our third guess and scored our Wordle win-in-three with the correct answer DAISY. Another daily game down and another tick on the newest win-streak.
