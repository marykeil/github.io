## Literature Review

The new week brings a new Wordle and today&#39;s answer shouldn&#39;t be too difficult for most. Here are the daily hints, and fully spoiled answer.





The popularity of Wordle came quickly when the game was first released and it&#39;s easy to see why. The single, daily method of distribution and simplistic, yet addictive, gameplay was the perfect recipe to create internet buzz. Copycats of the game cropped up all over the place and there was even a fan who made a version of Wordle in LEGO. All this excitement, and the excellent social media sharing ability quickly grew Wordle into what it is today, the perfect little break in any player&#39;s day.

 Today&#39;s Wordle Answer

The December 18th Wordle answer is FUNNY.

To begin our Monday Wordle we used the starting word IRATE, which provided only incorrect letters. Since we often use the same starting word it was easy to jump into our second guess and cover the rest of the vowels with POUND. One correctly placed &#39;N&#39; and the misplaced &#39;U&#39; were shuffled to try our third guess SUNNY. This basically locked in the answer for us with four out of five correct letters.

For our fourth attempt we tried BUNNY, this was also incorrect but victory was clearly close at hand. We finally locked in a Wordle win-in-five with the correct answer, FUNNY. Another game down and another notch on the newly refreshed win streak.
