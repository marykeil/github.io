Steeped in Bliss gives everyone within its range a boost in energy to correspond with their euphoria. However, the condition also makes its victims open to psychic suggestions. Mechanically, the condition provides an advantage for physical checks but a disadvantage for mental Saving Throws and a new vulnerability to Psychic damage. If you manage to collect this simple artifact, you will need to be strategic while using it.

 Should You Use The Resonance Stone In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3? 
          

The Resonance Stone takes effect if you have it in your inventory, affecting yourself and all beings in range (except for the undead or constructs). The Advantage it gives on physical checks can be useful if your character and your party prefer to focus on swinging swords and axes about. However, your enemies will also get this bonus when they come in to swing at you. 




                  10 Most Powerful Broken Items In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is packed full of powerful items for players to hunt down and wield, some of which are wonderfully broken in the best possible way.   

On the other end, the Resonance Stone will give you a disadvantage on mental Saving Throws in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which could lead to death with a poor roll of the dice. Your heightened vulnerability against Psychic damage will make fighting enemies with such attacks difficult. If you want to turn this disadvantage into a battlefield strategy, you can get in range of an enemy and use your own Psychic/mental attacks against them.

For most characters, keeping the Resonance Stone around probably isn&#39;t a good idea. However, if you want to challenge yourself or think you can use the item&#39;s condition in your favor, head to the Mind Flayer Colony and see if it spawned into your current playthrough of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
