## Literature Review

An aerial boss battle takes place against Moragia in Zelda: TOTK, which may take several strategies and tricks to beat using a hovering Zonai vehicle.





You will encounter Moragia during the &#34;Yunobo of Goron City&#34; quest, one of the four major Regional Phenomena that Link must investigate. As you arrive at Death Mountain, you will learn that the monster is made of magma, and you must defeat it with Yunobo&#39;s help.

As soon as the cutscene is over, there will be a Zonai Glider Device to the right, which you can use to get airborne and battle Moragia. The key here is to remain on the glider and navigate the glider directly to Moragia&#39;s head. By using the A Button, you will be able to fire Yunobo like a flaming ball towards Moragia from the glider. You can fire Yunobo as many times to damage Moragia as you will have unlimited ammunition.

During the battle, Moragia will shoot balls of fire; therefore, it is recommended to remain as close to the ground as possible. This will give you more time to dodge Moragia&#39;s attacks. Yunobo will warn you when Moragia is going to strike next, so you will have a bit of extra help in predicting the boss&#39; next moves.






You can defeat Moragia by destroying all three heads with the damage dealt by Yunobo, whom Link uses as a projectile attack while controlling a Zonai glider.




To defeat Moragia, you will need to destroy all three heads using Yunobo, who deals massive damage whenever their attacks hit the boss. A small dotted line shows the direction you can shoot Yunobo, which may be hard to aim while controlling the movement of the glider. Each head can be destroyed in one shot if you aim for the mouth, ending the boss fight in Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom with a cutscene when all three are taken down.

Yunobo the Goron is an incredible help for this fight and can easily take down Moragia with a few well-placed shots. Learning the right strategies to beat Moragia gives you a constant companion throughout the game, who becomes useful in other boss fights, such as Marbled Gohma in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
