## Literature Review

Regardless of the Contestant you main, you&#39;ll want to know which of the three abilities for each class is the most effective in securing cashouts.





Character, or hero abilities, are one of the many things The Finals does better than other FPS games. They aren&#39;t necessarily an ultimate that can completely wipe out another team, but you should use them if you want your team to have a chance at securing the cashout. That&#39;s because, while some abilities are powerful on their own, others can be combined with your teammates to form some pretty unstoppable combos. And, given that The Finals features cross-play and cross-progression between PC and Next-Gen, you can bet that many teams will be looking to harmonize their classes&#39; abilities.
Abilities, if not already unlocked, will cost 600 VRs to unlock. 










 








 9  Goo Gun - Heavy 
        

Although the Goo Gun for the Heavy class sounds good in theory, it isn&#39;t as effective in practice. You could use Goo Grenades instead of the Goo Gun to get a more effective goo-based item for the heavy class. The only real argument for this ability is that it can patch holes in walls and can make reaching and stealing the cash out a more difficult process than it already is.





 8  Recon Senses - Medium 
        

Recon Senses is another ability that, while useful, isn&#39;t as effective as it could be. The Recon Senses ability, as you might expect, allows you to see opponents behind walls. It does not, however, apply to your teammates. Furthermore, the Medium class has access to Sonar Grenades, which works just as well as this ability, if not better.





 7  Evasive Dash - Light 
        

Evasive Dash for the Light class in The Finals is akin to Tracer&#39;s dash in Overwatch. This ability gives you three quick dashes that constantly refresh after you use them.
If it wasn&#39;t for the fact that this is a solo ability, it would most likely rank higher on this list. After all, you can quickly dash into combat, grab your teammate&#39;s respawn beacon, and dash out to safely revive them. You can be a pretty deadly threat with this ability, and isn&#39;t one you should overlook.





 6  Guardian Turret - Medium 
        

The Guardian Turret is a solid option for the Medium class, but not the best one. That&#39;s because the Guardian Turret doesn&#39;t do as much damage as you would think, nor does it have as much health as you might think. As a result, it&#39;s not a bad idea to place it next to a secured cashout, but it won&#39;t scare away the enemy teams. That being said, a full trio of Medium Contestants all outfitted with this ability would be troublesome.
The Medium class also has access to the APS Turret in its Gadgets. This shoots down projectiles and is a great option to run alongside the Guardian Turret. 






 5  Grappling Hook - Light 
        

If you consider yourself a movement god, then go with the Grappling Hook ability for the Light Class. Although it is purely a movement-based ability, it has many uses in combat and objective play, such as getting you to Vaults before others, setting up an ambush on another team, or simply making a nice play on an opponent. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that it ranks higher on this list because it is one of the most fun abilities to use.





 4  Mesh Shield - Heavy 
        

One of the more powerful abilities is the Heavy class&#39;s Mesh Shield. Think of it like Reinhardt&#39;s shield in Overwatch - actually, it&#39;s exactly like that. Nonetheless, this is one of the best abilities because it absorbs damage and forces an enemy team to maneuver around your shield to deal damage to you or your team.
What&#39;s more, the Heavy class can be equipped with a &#34;Dome Shield&#34; Gadget, which you throw to deploy a shield bubble. Together, they make for a fantastic tank/support build.





 3  Charge &#39;N&#39; Slam - Heavy Class 
        

Charge &#39;N&#39; Slam is easily the best ability in The Finals for the Heavy Class. This ability allows you to charge in a fit of rage, destroying walls and damaging enemies in your path. It&#39;s one of the best abilities for, well, tearing down a wall and opening up another angle of attack. However, it is also useful for engaging in fights and getting other teams to stop camping in the corner or around their cashout.
If you want to add even more destruction to the mix, the Heavy&#39;s Gadgets can be made up of C4 and an RPG-7. 






 2  Cloaking Device - Light 
        

The Cloaking Device may be the most powerful ability in the game right now. Essentially, it makes the light class invisible for a short period of time. Attacking while invisible will cancel the ability, which can simply be reactivated. You can use this ability in conjunction with the Light class&#39;s Dagger to quickly cheese opponents to death in two or three stabs. However, you&#39;re probably already brainstorming ways to troll enemies with this ability.





 1  Healing Beam - Medium 
        

The Healing Beam for the Medium class slides in the number one spot because it is the most useful ability for your team. Running this ability alongside two Heavy Contestants creates a painfully difficult fight in which other teams must target the Medium Contestant to crack the two Heavys.
You can also equip the &#34;Defibrillator&#34; Gadget to the Medium Class, which acts as an instant revive for down teammates. Together, they turn the Medium class into a dedicated Medic build, which is arguably the best ability/gadget setup you can have in The Finals.
