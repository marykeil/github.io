## Literature Review

Hisuian Qwilfish and Overqwil return from Legends: Arceus in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. Here’s how to get both these creatures in the Gen 9 games.





While the original creature does not evolve into any Pokémon, Hisuian Qwilfish has an evolution called Overqwil. This is considered a Gen 8 monster. To obtain Overqwil in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, you had to evolve it from Hisuian Qwilfish. The process involved a special training method, which saw Hisuian Qwilfish utilize Barb Barrage in its Strong Style 20 times in battle and then level up. With the lack of Legends: Arceus’ Strong and Agile Style mechanic, there is another way of evolving Hisuian Qwilfish in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet’s Indigo Disk DLC.




                  How To Find (&amp; Catch) Meloetta (Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC)   Meloetta is one of the many legendary pocket monsters that have become available in the Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet Indigo Disk DLC.   


 How To Get Overqwil In The Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC 
          

To get Overqwil, you will first need to catch Hisuian Qwilfish. This creature is located in the waters of the Polar Biome in the Terarium. This is not a version-exclusive Pokémon the Indigo Disk DLC, so you do not have to worry about not finding it, regardless of the version of the game you own. Once you catch Hisuian Qwilfish, you can start moving toward evolving it. Unlike in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, you do not have to make Qwilfish use a special move 20 times to evolve it in the Indigo Disk DLC.

Instead, what you will need to do is ensure that your Hisuian Qwilfish knows the move Barb Barrage. If you caught it and it does not know the move, you can access its Summary and, in the Moves and Stats page, use the feature to change its moves. At the level it is caught, it should be able to remember Barb Barrage in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk.






If you are importing a Hisuian Qwilfish from Legends: Arceus or Pokémon GO via Pokémon HOME or are breeding one with better stats, it may not be able to learn Barb Barrage immediately. The move is unlocked at level 28.




After your Hisuian Qwilfish has learned the move Barb Barrage, you can evolve it into Overqwil by leveling it a single time. This can be done by the traditional method, which consists of battling, or through Exp. Candy or Rare Candy. Obtaining Overqwil should help you toward your progress in completing the Pokédex in the Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC. Evolving Hisuian Qwilfish in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet is not hard – in fact, it is easier than in Legends: Arceus – but it is necessary to know what to do to put your hands on Overqwil.
