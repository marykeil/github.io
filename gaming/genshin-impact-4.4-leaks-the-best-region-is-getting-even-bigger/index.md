# Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks The Best Region Is Getting Even Bigger


## SUMMARY 



  Genshin Impact Version 4.4 leaks suggest that a pre-existing region will be expanded with two new areas.   These new areas may be related to an upcoming event and could provide new story content and exploration opportunities.   The leaked expansion may eventually connect to the region of Fontaine, potentially opening up a route.

## Literature Review

It seems like the best region in Genshin Impact may be getting an extension in Version 4.4. Here is what this could mean for the story.




One of the best regions in Genshin Impact may become even bigger according to some new Version 4.4 leaks. It is common for the world of Teyvat to expand every so often and it seems like a pre-existing region will be getting new extensions in the upcoming patch. Of course, this is only possible with pre-existing areas, as the new nation is still a ways off. The release of Natlan in Genshin Impact is expected for some point in Summer 2024, so the discussed new areas expand nations that have already been explored. Fontaine is in the spotlight, considering it debuted this year and introduced new gameplay mechanics.




However, it may be another region that will expand. This is somewhat unlike the regular behavior for the game. During the previous year in the game, most of the map extensions were all related to Sumeru, the nation that was released in 2022. This time around, Fontaine may not be getting as much attention as its predecessor. Nevertheless, this does not mean it is completely out of the loop. There have been many discussed details about the upcoming patch, such as the mention of new skins in Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks, so a few new map areas do not seem like a long shot.

 Liyue May Get Two New Areas In Genshin Impact 4.4 
          




According to a set of new details revealed by the leaker known as Foul, then shared in a post on Reddit, there will be two new Statues of the Seven added with Genshin Impact 4.4. Essentially, this means that there may be two new discoverable areas in the game with the upcoming patch. As seen in the image in the post, these two new areas may be an extension of the Liyue region. The circles that highlight the alleged location of the Statues of the Seven are located to the northwest of Bishui Plain. The post is tagged as “Questionable” so it should be taken with a grain of salt.



To be more specific, one of the Statues of the Seven seems to be directly west of Mount Aocang, while the other is slightly northwest of Qingce Village.






 Liyue’s Leaked Map Extension May Be   To Lantern Rite In Genshin Impact 
         




While unconfirmed and leaning heavily into speculation, these two new areas in Liyue that are bound to arrive with Version 4.4 may be related to 2024’s version of the annual Lantern Rite Festival event. There have already been leaks regarding the upcoming patch, such as Cloud Retainer’s release date in Genshin Impact, and this may be enough evidence to back up the map leaks. The Liyue adepti’s release seems to be on par with the arrival of the patch and the Lantern Rite itself, and seeing that this is a Liyue-exclusive event, the map extensions may be a way of allowing Lantern Rite to be played in a different manner.

Even with a large map extension, namely the Chasm, most of Liyue has already been explored. Aside from new stories that can be included, there are no new places these stories can be told, so the Version 4.4 leaks sound promising. Instead of repeating the process of taking players to Cloud Retainer’s lair in Mount Aocang and back to Liyue Harbor, exclusively, new areas can help players better understand the region’s past. This is what is usually explored during the Lantern Rite in Genshin Impact. Inside these new areas, players could explore the former lairs of Guizhong and Streetward Rambler, for instance.




                  Genshin Impact Leaks: Xiao&#39;s Rerun Is Perfect For One New Character   It seems like Xiao is getting a rerun in Genshin Impact. That may actually be great news, as he allegedly pairs up well with a new character.   

These two important adepti in the story of the region were the highlights of 2023’s Lantern Rite, along with Cloud Retainer’s human form, so seeing them once more, perhaps promoting another heart-wrenching narrative in their places of respite could make for great story content. There is no confirmation Lantern Rite will delve into these new areas, but given they are allegedly in the Liyue region and being added when the event is held in Genshin Impact, the chances are fairly high. Of course, these being located on the map of Teyvat rather than temporary locations like the Veluriyam Mirage, there should be more to the areas.

If the Version 4.4 leaks are true, then these new areas need to be designed as regular areas with a lot to explore and unlock. This goes from regular Waypoints to new enemies and maybe even new world bosses. New exploration mechanics are usually related to specific x.0 updates, so that would probably be left out. Nonetheless, there are plenty of reasons to further explore the Nation of Contracts. Liyue is Genshin Impact’s best region, but it has not seen a large increase in its territory with it already being huge at launch. It did have the Chasm added, but that is treated as an area of its own.






 Leaked Liyue Areas In Genshin Impact Could Eventually Connect To Fontaine 
          

In addition to the expansion of the best region in the game, the two leaked areas in Liyue seem to be hinting at a connection to Fontaine. While the zones are direct extensions of Liyue’s Bishui Plain, it does seem like the map of Teyvat in that area is opening up and moving toward the Nation of Justice. Granted, Fontaine is set atop a large plateau that is accessed by giant elevators at the base of the sea that surrounds it. Nevertheless, the new areas may be establishing a route in Genshin Impact, even if players still need to go an elevator ride to reach the Nation of Hydro.

Continuously moving northwest from Bishui Plain could, technically, take players to Fontaine, so this could be the first step in drawing that bridge. Currently, the map layout requires players to travel from Liyue to Sumeru, cross the Great Red Sand, head northwest past the Desert of Hadramaveth and the Realm of Farakhkert, to only then reach the waters that lead into Fontaine. Even if there are teleport points along the way and a fast-travel feature, it is a long path, geographically speaking. Eventually, this could open up the possibility of a Fontaine-based expansion of the map in Genshin Impact, which moves towards the new areas added in Version 4.4.




As is the case with any leak, however, the remarks about these two new areas in Liyue should be taken with a grain of salt. Leaked information can be incorrect or subject to change ahead of the Version’s release. Nevertheless, expanding the size of the best region in Genshin Impact seems like a good plan, giving players more reason to explore Liyue and its lore-rich territory.
