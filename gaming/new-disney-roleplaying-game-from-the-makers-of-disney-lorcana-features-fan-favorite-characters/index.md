## Literature Review

Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) is an upcoming game from the makers of Disney Lorcana that&#39;s set to release in 2024.




Ravensburger, the maker of Disney Lorcana, has announced a new Disney TTRPG-inspired game called Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition). The game sees Pixar and Disney characters banding together in a shared universe to take on a sinister darkness that&#39;s spreading across the world. Alongside the reveal, Ravensburger also announced a release date and price for Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) and which fan-favorite characters will be playable.




The new Disney roleplaying game is following in the footsteps of Ravensburger&#39;s successful trading card game, Disney Lorcana, which will be receiving its third set, Into the Inklands, in March. Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) will combine storytelling and roleplaying in a co-op format that promises to have the &#34;approachability of a board game.&#34; Players will work together to form alliances between Pixar and Disney heroines, who take on a crystallized form in the realm, as they attempt to push back the Disney Villains.

Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) is recommended for 4 players, ages 8 and up. The price is $29.99 and is set to be released at Target and hobby stores on July 21, 2024. Additionally, pre-orders for Target.com have been announced for July 7, 2024. At this time, further release information has not been revealed. However, Ravensburger has stated that &#34;more gameplay details and illustrations will be unveiled at various game events throughout the year.&#34; Although not officially confirmed, this is presumably when more character details will be shown.

Fully designed and illustrated by women, Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) will feature four playable heroines spread across fan-favorite properties from Disney and Pixar. The four playable characters are: Moana, Violet from The Incredibles, Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and Maid Marian from Robin Hood. It&#39;s unclear if other characters will become playable over the lifespan of the game, but it&#39;s assumed this will be the case.




Chronicles of Light: Darkness Falls (Disney Edition) will also feature other items, characters, and creatures from popular Disney and Pixar films, which players will encounter on their quests. If the popularity and high quality of Disney Lorcana is any indication, the new Disney game from Ravensburger will have a lot to look forward to when it releases later in 2024.
