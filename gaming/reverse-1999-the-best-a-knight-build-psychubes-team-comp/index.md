## Literature Review

A Knight is a high-tier DPS character in Reverse 1999. His kit revolves around last-hitting enemies to generate Moxie for his powerful Ultimate.





The main goal with A Knight&#39;s play style is to get enough moxie and weaken the enemies enough to where After AD 778 can kill them and give the team Rousing Morale, which boosts their next Attack DMG by 50%. If his other Incantations, Justice and Glory, are fully leveled up, A Knight can get his Ultimate ready after using both Incantations once, wiping out the field in a single round.






A Knight is a high-tier 6-Star character who will rarely get extra Afflatus damage from enemies due to his rare Spirit Afflatus.





 The Best Psychubes For A Knight 
          

When picking Psychubes for A Knight in Reverse 1999, you&#39;ll want to focus on A Knight&#39;s Moxie. While his Incantations give him plenty of Moxie when fully leveled up, they only do so when A Knight defeats an enemy. If you want to make the most of A Knight&#39;s Incantations, you&#39;ll need to save his attacks for when they can take out an enemy weakened by his allies. That way, A Knight can trigger After AD 778 more often. This gives him more chances to kill an enemy with his Ultimate and bestow Rousing Morale.






One of the best Psychubes available in Reverse 1999&#39;s global launch for A Knight has to be Hopscotch, a 6-Star Psychube for DPS characters.




Hopscotch amplifies A Knight&#39;s defeat bonuses from After AD 778. When this Psychube is fully leveled up, for each enemy A Knight defeats, he&#39;ll get up to 4 stacks of &#43;8% Ultimate Might. This encourages players to use A Knight&#39;s Incantations as finishing moves to increase the power of his Ultimate. at Level 60, Hopscotch provides an 18% Incantation Might bonus, making it easier for A Knight to defeat an enemy and get his Moxie.

                  Genshin Impact 4.2: How To Get Freminet For Free   During Version 4.2, you will be able to obtain a free copy of Freminet in Genshin Impact. Hereâ€™s how to unlock the free 4-star Cryo character.    

If Hopscotch isn&#39;t your style, you can also try Brave New World, another 6-Star Psychube. Brave New World is, in some ways, an inverse of Hopscotch. It provides 18% Ultimate Might at Level 60 and its Amplification focuses on Incantation Might. At Level 5, Brave New World boosts the Incantation Might of the next Incantation following A Knight&#39;s Ultimate by 40%. If you use Glory after A Knight&#39;s Ultimate, you can finish off any enemies that survived his powerful assault with After AD 778.




If you&#39;re struggling to keep A Knight alive, you can give him His Bounden Duty, which provides an overall damage bonus of 12% at Level 60. Like Hopscotch and Brave New World, His Bounden Duty centers itself around defeating enemies. When A Knight defeats an enemy, he can heal HP equal to his ATK plus 120% when the Psychube&#39;s Amplification is at Level 5. Considering how often A Knight defeats enemies, His Bounden Duty should keep him alive through difficult fights. Still, Hopscotch and Brave New World are preferable to this Psychube.

                  Zenless Zone Zero Feels Nothing Like Genshin Impact Or Honkai Star Rail (&amp; That&#39;s A Good Thing)   Zenless Zone Zero is soon to be the latest member of the HoYoverse family of games, and it&#39;s also the most different. That&#39;s a good thing.    



All three of these Psychubes are 6-Star, which makes them hard to collect. If you&#39;re lucky enough to get A Knight early but lack any of these Psychubes, you&#39;ll probably have to make do with a 4-Star Psychube. At Reverse 1999&#39;s global launch, there are two 4-Star Psychubes centered around ATK. Out of those two, Bow is the better Psychube for A Knight with its 9% Incantation Might bonus.









 The Best Team Comps For A Knight 
          

When you bring A Knight into combat, he&#39;ll have two other characters supporting him. Since A Knight acts as the main damage dealer of any team he joins, you&#39;ll need to pick characters that can either support his attacks or increase his chances of survival by healing him or shielding him. This second role is less important if you have His Bounden Duty, but proves useful in A Knight&#39;s best team comps.

Bkornblume is an excellent support character focused on Debuffs, Burst DMG, and Control. When her Debuff Incantation, Prying Ear, is fully upgraded, it lowers the Reality DEF of all enemies by 25% while increasing damage to them by 25% for three rounds. Since A Knight deals Reality DMG, this increases his chance of defeating an enemy when he takes an action. Once Bkornblume uses Prying Ear, she can activate her Attack Incantation, Watch Your Sleeves, and gain a DMG bonus thanks to the enemies&#39; lowered stats.




                  Honkai: Star Rail 1.6 - Every Confirmed Playable Character   Three new playable characters have been confirmed for Honkai: Star Rail 1.6, two of which are 5-star heroes. Here are more details about them.    

Tennant pairs well with Bkornblume &amp; A Knight as another Debuff character with Shield and DPS tags. This 5-Star Beast character&#39;s role on the team is to wear down enemies for A Knight to come in and finish them off. Tennant&#39;s Attack Incantation targets one enemy at a time but deals more base DMG than A Knight&#39;s Incantations at the same level. Since she deals Reality DMG, she can benefit from Bkornblume&#39;s Debuff. When the team needs a boost, she can supply a shield to block 20% of all DMG taken.



When you enter combat with A Knight, Bkornblume, &amp; Tennant, weaken enemies with Prying Ear, then target them with Tennant&#39;s Attack Incantation, A Shiny Diamond. When the enemies are a hit away from death, have A Knight finish them off. Let Bkornblume and Tennant widdle enemies down and save A Knight&#39;s moves for when they can be fully utilized.




Sonetto can easily replace Bkornblume or Tennant thanks to her status as a F2P character. She is a top-tier unit with DPS, Control, and Support capabilities. When Commandment V is Level 2 or Level 3, she can prevent her target from attacking for a round or two while dealing Reality DMG. Meanwhile, Exhortation IX is an excellent DMG buff for A Knight to finish off his enemies.




While these characters are the best for a team comp centered around A Knight, there are plenty of other characters who synergize with A Knight. Dikke can heal the team and keep A Knight going until he can play his cards. An-an Lee provides consistent DPS and excellent buffs. You can even use Door and Necrologist in a unique Moxie generating team comp where Door dies to generate Moxie only for Necrologist to revive him. With the right characters supporting him, A Knight can be one of the best DPS units in Reverse 1999.
