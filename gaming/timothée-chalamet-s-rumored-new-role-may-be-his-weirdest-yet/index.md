## Literature Review

Timothée Chalamet is no stranger to unusual parts, but he could be going weirder than ever in one potential project currently in the works.




It&#39;s starting to look like Timothée Chalamet could be making an appearance in Death Stranding 2, and this upcoming role could be the strangest one he&#39;s yet taken on. The world of Death Stranding is complex, but the one thing that&#39;s consistent about it is the weirdness that it brings to the table. Although post-apocalyptic America isn&#39;t an unfamiliar concept, Death Stranding avoids standard tropes like zombies and rigid dystopic societies for a more unusual flavor. Character names like Die-Hardman immediately make it obvious how off-kilter things can be, while the nuances of figures like Higgs combine compelling characterization and memorable quirks seamlessly.




Chalamet is no stranger to unusual parts, as a brief glance at his most recent projects makes clear. The upcoming film Wonka has him step into the shoes previously filled by Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp, bringing the most eccentric chocolate-maker imaginable to life once more. His role in Dune is set to get weirder with Part Two, which will see the character of Paul Atreides progress on a more metaphysical journey than yet revealed. Chalamet&#39;s performance in The French Dispatch leaned into the quirky affectations common to Wes Anderson films, and his character in Bones and All pushed well beyond what society is generally willing to accept.

                  Death Stranding 2 Confirmed With A Very Hideo Kojima Trailer   An official trailer showcased during The Game Awards 2022 reveals Death Stranding 2, the ambitious next project from gaming legend Hideo Kojima.

Death Stranding 2&#39;s director, Hideo Kojima, is no stranger to fraternizing with Hollywood celebrities, and Timothée Chalamet is the latest to grace his presence, as revealed in a tweet from the official Hideo Kojima English Twitter account. Kojima and Chalamet posed with a statue of the Kojima Productions mascot Ludens in a couple of photos, while another features Chalamet holding a figure of Paddington, a character that Kojima loves.


 

Although nothing can be said for certain, many Death Stranding roles are played by Hollywood actors, making it possible that Timothée Chalamet could indeed be making an appearance in Death Stranding 2. At the very least, Chalemet&#39;s visit to Kojima Productions could mean he makes a cameo in the upcoming game.






 Who Timothée Chalamet Could Play In Death Stranding 2 
          

If Death Stranding 2 does feature Timothée Chalamet, he&#39;s likely to be in a side role, as he hasn&#39;t been advertised as being part of the cast so far. Even if he didn&#39;t get a lot of screen time, however, it&#39;s easy to make a memorable impression with just a minor appearance in the world of Death Stranding. The first game featured quirky cameos from figures like Conan O&#39;Brien and The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley, and a smaller role would give Chalamet the perfect chance to indulge in an off-the-wall personality without running the risk of anything wearing thin.

There&#39;s no guarantee that Timothée Chalamet will appear in Death Stranding 2, as Kojima does socialize with actors who haven&#39;t appeared in his works. Some Kojima Productions visitors like director Edgar Wright and synth-pop band CHVRCHES did appear in the first title, however, so there&#39;s certainly hope. A Death Stranding film is also in the works, which could be on the table for Chalamet. Whatever the future may hold, it seems entirely possible that Timothée Chalamet could turn his silver screen talents to a video game role in Death Stranding 2 that highlights the weirdness he so often brings to life.
