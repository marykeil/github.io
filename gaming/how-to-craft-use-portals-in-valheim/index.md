## Literature Review

Fast travel is extremely important for getting from place to place in Valheim, so you&#39;ll need to craft and use Portals to teleport over far distances.





Making Portals is one of the first things to know in Valheim that helps you explore the overwhelming large world you and your friends are in. A Portal acts as a fast travel point between two places you can set up as you please. However, despite how quick and easy it is to use a Portal, it can be tricky to actually craft a pair of them for a base design or set them up for expeditions on the map.

 How To Craft Portals 
          

The first materials you need to start crafting a Portal are Bronze Bars and a Forge structure that most likely sits at your home base. Portals are necessary for fast travel from your base out into areas farther and farther away from your starting location in Valheim. Make a tool called the Bronze Axe in your Forge to chop down large trees in the world for the other resources you must collect.

Search around the forests in the world for Fine Wood in Valheim, which is one of the cornerstone items for any Portal. Gather about 20 Fine Wood from Oak and Birch trees that you can cut down with your Bronze Axe. The other materials necessary for a Portal are 10 Graydwarf Eyes and 2 Surtling Cores, but these items are a bit harder to discover than the basic Wood you&#39;ve been hoarding.




Surtling Cores are found in the Black Forest biome in Valheim, while Graydwarf Eyes are part of Graydwarf enemies that drop when you kill these hostile creatures. Anyone who regularly loots the enemies they kill should have more than enough for at least one Portal. When you have everything you need, head to your nearest Workbench to start building a Portal with the right crafting items.



Those who want to make a connected Portal pathway need to have twice the materials needed to build a Portal since they need to make two at two different points on the map to travel between.






 How To Use Portals 
          

Once you have two Portals constructed, you have to interact with them to alter their tags to the same name as one another. This connects the Portals in Valheim and lets you travel between only the ones with the same title. For example, if you place one Portal in your base and name it &#34;Merchant,&#34; you have to use that same title with another Portal somewhere else for it to be the fast travel destination.




Keep in mind that you can&#39;t transport Ores or Metal Bars through Portals and that the titles for each one you set up are case-sensitive. You can have six Portals set up in Valheim, with one at your base and another five scattered throughout the open world. All you need to do to travel between each is to change the title of the one at your home base to the same as another already on the map.

Learning how to craft and use Portals in Valheim makes traveling far more convenient for resource farming missions and to avoid dangerous zones along the way to places of interest.
