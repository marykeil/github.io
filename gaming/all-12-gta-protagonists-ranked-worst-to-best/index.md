## Literature Review

While the crime-sim series is full of iconic and memorable faces, it&#39;s the best GTA protagonists who have ultimately made it what it is today.




Being at the forefront of the franchise, the protagonists of the Grand Theft Auto series can make or break a game, and some characters certainly rank better than others in the grand scheme of things. With each having a distinct personality, a unique story, and an important role in the game, they&#39;re each integral to the world of GTA in their own special ways — but when it comes to the enjoyment of the player, there are some prominent front-runners (and some equally prominent underdogs).
The recent release of the GTA 6 trailer revealed more about Lucia, Grand Theft Auto&#39;s first-ever female protagonist. Her story will take place in the expanded world of Vice City, in the fictional state of Leonida, GTA&#39;s version of Florida. Though much can be ascertained by the new protagonist through the trailer — like the fact she has a criminal past and will be part of a Bonnie and Clyde duo with a male character purportedly named Jason — people will still need to wait for the full release of the game to get a better taste of the duo&#39;s personalities, and how they stack up with the rest of the best protagonists in GTA.
            
 
 10 Hidden Details You Probably Missed In GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer 
There was a ton that was packed in the minute-and-a-half Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer — so much so that there might be a few details you missed. 












 








 12  Claude (Grand Theft Auto 3) 
Also Appears In GTA San Andreas, GTA Online


 







Claude is the worst GTA protagonist, which isn&#39;t too surprising, considering that he was Rockstar Games&#39; first foray into the 3D realm. Despite being the main character of Grand Theft Auto 3, he didn&#39;t receive any voice acting, and as such, he never utters a single word throughout the length of the game. There&#39;s no denying that Claude was pivotal to the entire Grand Theft Auto franchise, as his 3D playable character model proved highly successful and single-handedly changed the future of the crime-sim series. But compared to the others, he is at an inherent disadvantage with his lack of a personality.
Claude Speed is the protagonist from the top-down GTA 2, though Rockstar has never confirmed whether Claude from GTA 3 is indeed the same Claude, there are theories linking the two, and the fact they share the same name contributes to this confusion. 






 11  Toni Cipriani (Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories) 
Also Appears In GTA 3
        

Toni Cipriani is the protagonist of Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories and a main character in GTA 3, who unfortunately suffers from his duality. In Liberty City Stories, Mr. Tough Guy was a pleasant character, with his mafia ties and undying loyalty to the Leone family making his story quite exciting to take part in — but his initial cameo in GTA 3 is underwhelming at best. While he shines during his time as a playable protagonist, it&#39;s hard to look past the bland, cookie-cutter mob boss that Toni becomes only a few years down the Grand Theft Auto timeline.
            
 
 GTA 6: Famous Actors&#39; Characters That Could Return 
Grand Theft Auto 6 has a chance to bring back some of the series&#39; most famous voices while furthering the stories of their respective characters.








 10  Huang Lee (GTA: Chinatown Wars) 
Also Referenced In GTA 4
        

Huang Lee is an underrated GTA protagonist featured in Chinatown Wars and is known for his wit and personality. His approach is more cerebral than some of the more comical GTA protagonists. Son of a murdered Triad leader, Lee&#39;s story stands as one of GTA&#39;s more serious character arcs as he goes on to deliver a family heirloom to the new Triad leader in Liberty City.
            
 
 GTA: Chinatown Wars Deserves A Sequel 
Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars has a unique feel unlike any other game in the GTA series. After so long, it&#39;s time for Huang Lee to return.



Huang was featured in the Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars, a hand-held version of GTA for the DS, PlayStation Portable, and mobile devices. Because the game was released in 2009 for portable devices and did not feature a voice for Huang Lee, he&#39;s an often overlooked GTA protagonist, but one that should be remembered for his compelling revenge plot and story of self-discovery.





 9  Victor Vance (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories) 
Also Featured In GTA Vice City
        

Being the main character in Vice City Stories and also playing a minor role in GTA: Vice City, Victor Vance&#39;s story is far more compelling than that of Toni Cipriani&#39;s. Unlike most GTA protagonists, Vic never planned on becoming a crime boss; his only goal was to provide for his struggling family by any means necessary.


At first, this meant being a devout member of the military, but when his superior ordered him to partake in illegal activities, he was eventually discharged and left with no other choice. Whereas most protagonists in Grand Theft Auto do it for the riches or the fame, Vic does it for survival and for his family, which sets him apart.





 8  Johnny Klebitz (Grand Theft Auto IV: The Lost and Damned) 
Also Appears In GTA 5 &amp; The Ballad Of Gay Tony
        

Johnny Klebitz, who is the protagonist of GTA 4&#39;s The Lost and Damned DLC, has an even more tragic story than Victor. When Billy, the president of the Lost MC, gets sent to rehab, Johnny steps up to the role, acting as the biker gang&#39;s strong and level-headed leader. Things quickly get turned upside down, and he is forced to carefully navigate through multiple betrayals in order to keep the Lost MC afloat. His brief reappearance in GTA 5 sees Johnny die an unceremonious death, but in his life, he was one of the better GTA protagonists from a story standpoint.
            
 
 All Real-Life Locations Revealed For GTA 6 (So Far) 
GTA 6 contains an impressive level of detail in its rendering of real-world locations. Here are nine Florida landmarks that have appeared in trailers.








 7  Franklin Clinton (Grand Theft Auto 5) 
Portrayed By Shawn Fonteno


 







The debate about which GTA 5 protagonist is best is still ongoing, a decade after the game&#39;s release — but one sentiment that most fans can agree on is that Franklin Clinton is likely the weakest of the bunch. There&#39;s no denying that he&#39;s an integral part of the infamous trio, being the coolest, calmest, and most collected by a long shot, but being the voice of reason inherently makes him a bit less exciting than Michael or Trevor. That being said, it&#39;s still interesting to see him develop as a character as he slowly becomes more adept in the criminal world. Franklin is also featured in GTA Online.





 6  Luis Fernando Lopez (Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad Of Gay Tony) 
Also Featured In GTA 4 &amp; The Lost And Damned
        

Luis Fernando Lopez, who played the star role of GTA 3&#39;s The Ballad of Gay Tony DLC, is one of the funniest GTA protagonists and a true joy to play as. During the events of the expansion, he finds himself in an increasingly sticky situation as his boss and best friend, Tony, gets entangled with the wrong people. Despite the severity of the situation, though, Luis always finds a way to crack a joke or make a witty comment. His sense of humor and loyalty to Tony makes him one of the more memorable characters in the franchise.

Grand Theft Auto 6 hasn&#39;t officially revealed information outside of the trailer, but that one source has a lot of interesting information to glean.








 5  Michael De Santa (Grand Theft Auto 5) 
Portrayed By Ned Luke
        

Michael De Santa is no doubt one of the most iconic Grand Theft Auto protagonists. The former professional criminal is a true master of his craft, and the events of GTA 5 see him display his expertise to no end. But between his own internal conflicts and his hot-headed temperament that threatens to tear his family apart, Michael is a surprisingly multidimensional character. Witnessing his story — and his dynamic with other characters — slowly develop during the course of GTA 5 is one of the best parts of the game, which, in turn, makes Michael one of the best GTA protagonists.





 4  Trevor Philips (Grand Theft Auto 5) 
Portrayed By Steven Ogg


 







Michael De Santa might be the face of GTA 5, but Trevor Philips is a manifestation of what many players enjoy about the franchise: pure, unbridled chaos. Trevor&#39;s penchant for violence, alongside his unpredictable mentality and loyalty to his few loved ones, makes him a dangerous wild card that can surprise players just as much as his in-game opposition. There&#39;s never a dull moment with him around, and even though Trevor has a good side in GTA 5, it&#39;s his more prominent, nearly theatrical bad side that actually makes him one of the best characters in the entire series.
Trevor can also be found as a main character in GTA: Online. 






 3  Carl &#34;CJ&#34; Johnson (Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas) 
Voiced By Young Maylay
        

It would be impossible to discuss the best GTA protagonists without mentioning Carl Johnson, more commonly known as CJ, from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. In contrast to Trevor, CJ is a respectable young man who treats everyone with kindness but isn&#39;t afraid to put his foot down and get the job done (and oftentimes, crack a joke along the way). His down-to-earth personality, entertaining dynamic with the game&#39;s other characters, and his rags-to-riches story easily place him as one of the most memorable characters in the Grand Theft Auto series.





 2  Tommy Vercetti (Grand Theft Auto: Vice City) 
Also Referenced In Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
        

Tommy Vercetti could make a reappearance in the upcoming game since it takes place in the eponymous location of Grand Theft Auto: Vice City. But even though GTA 6 doesn&#39;t need Tommy to be successful, not many players would object to a cameo from one of GTA&#39;s best protagonists.
At the start of Vice City, the aptly named Harwood Butcher has fallen from glory, having just been released from prison after committing crimes for the Forelli family. Now imbued with a fiery vengeance and a determination to rule Vice City for himself, Tommy stops at nothing to work his way up to the top. It&#39;s his unfaltering dedication, intelligence, ruthlessness, and ultimate success story that makes him an understandable fan-favorite.





 1  Niko Bellic (Grand Theft Auto 4) 
Also Featured In The Ballad Of Gay Tony &amp; Mentioned In GTA 5
        

The best GTA protagonist is Niko Bellic, the main character of Grand Theft Auto 4. While other protagonists may have exciting stories and thrilling lifestyles, Niko&#39;s narrative is unique, as it&#39;s somber, realistic, and unexpectedly heavy-hitting.
In hopes of starting anew, the Serbian veteran came to Liberty City to leave his troubled past behind, but he eventually falls down a rabbit hole when he&#39;s faced with the measly reality of the &#34;American Dream&#34; he had once longed for. As such, he quickly adopts a more sinister goal, aiming to find and kill the traitor who got most of his crew (and nearly himself) killed during the Yugoslav Wars.
Unlike other GTA protagonists, Niko&#39;s morally gray actions aren&#39;t just a grab for cash or an attempt at notoriety. Fueled by his traumatic military history and the desire to finally close out a dark chapter, his life-or-death story makes the rest look like mere child&#39;s play. It&#39;s hard not to sympathize with his emotional narrative, which cements Niko Bellic as the best Grand Theft Auto protagonist.
