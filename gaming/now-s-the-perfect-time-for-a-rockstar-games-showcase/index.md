# Now s The Perfect Time For A Rockstar Games Showcase


## SUMMARY 



  Rockstar Games should have its own showcase to keep players updated on upcoming titles, similar to other major companies like PlayStation and Nintendo.   A full showcase for GTA 6 would give Rockstar the opportunity to show off new features and demonstrate how it has pushed the open-world gameplay even further.   A Rockstar showcase could also include updates on Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s current-gen upgrade and reveal updates for GTA Online or even a new GTA Online 2.

## Literature Review

With the amount of hype surrounding Rockstar Games titles, particularly GTA 6, now is the perfect time for the company to present its own showcase.




With the amount of hype surrounding Rockstar Games titles, particularly Grand Theft Auto 6, now is the perfect time for the company to present its own showcase. Other major companies started having their own showcases, such as PlayStation&#39;s State of Plays, Nintendo&#39;s Nintendo Directs, and the Xbox &amp; Bethesda joint showcases of recent years, the latter of which was used to provide an in-depth look at Starfield in June 2023.




These showcases proved to be a great way to keep players up to date with multiple upcoming titles without needing to wait for major events such as E3, which sadly has been canceled in recent years and shows no sign of returning. Rockstar previously uploaded its reveal trailers for Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 directly to YouTube in 2011 and 2018 respectively, two years before their release dates. Since then, however, Rockstar has opted to reveal some of its products via other companies&#39; showcases in recent years, with trailers for its PS5 and Xbox Series X remaster of GTA 5 shown at the PlayStation Showcase.

 GTA 6&#39;s First Trailer Could Be Shown At The Game Awards 
After So Many Years, GTA 6 Deserves Its Own Showcase
          

Many have speculated that the studio&#39;s highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer will be revealed as part of The Game Awards after Rockstar&#39;s President, Sam Houser confirmed the trailer would drop sometime in December to celebrate the company&#39;s 25th anniversary. Even if this were the case, it would likely be a story or teaser trailer providing a first look at the game&#39;s updated version of Vice City and its dual protagonists, Lucia and Jason, much like GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2&#39;s initial reveals.




A full showcase would give Rockstar the opportunity to show off more of the actual game itself after many years of waiting. In September 2022, 90 leaked early-development videos revealed some new mechanics for the franchise, such as overhauled robberies and heists that can now turn into fully controllable hostage situations, or somewhat ironically, the inclusion of hacking to allow for another kind of crime.

While these leaks did prove several rumors surrounding GTA 6&#39;s location and protagonists true long before Rockstar intended, the title is still one of the most highly anticipated in gaming at the time of writing. Therefore, a Rockstar showcase with a lengthy presentation detailing the game&#39;s new features and a demonstration of how Rockstar has pushed its already impressive open-world gameplay from last-gen&#39;s Red Dead Redemption 2 even further for current-gen devices through its new RAGE engine would certainly be worth it for many fans.

 Red Dead Redemption 2 Could Also Appear In A Showcase 
Many Are Still Hopeful For A Red Dead Redemption 2 Current-Gen Update
         

Although it&#39;s clear that Rockstar&#39;s attention is on Grand Theft Auto 6 at this time, the company does have several highly acclaimed IPs in its portfolio, both as a publisher and a developer that it could provide updates for during a showcase. While a lot of these IPs such as Bully, Midnight Club, L.A. Noire, or the controversial Manhunt have been abandoned or have had sequels canceled over the years, there are still other existing titles that have regular players and generate plenty of revenue for the studio.

As reported by IGN, more people are currently playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on Steam than ever before, with 77,655 players in the final weekend of November 2023. This boost came over five years from the game&#39;s original launch on consoles, and over four years on from its PC release thanks to the Steam Autumn Sale offering a 67% discount for the title, but it shows the title&#39;s immense popularity is still there.




Red Dead Redemption 2 was praised for building a highly detailed, visually impressive world that could change in real time the longer players inhabit Rockstar&#39;s fictional take on America, even on PS4 and Xbox One hardware. Despite this, many console players are still hopeful for a current-gen upgrade for the title to grant it even better fidelity and framerates like other titles on modern devices. A report in July 2022 said such a project was in the works but was canceled upon Rockstar shifting resources to GTA 6&#39;s development.



Currently, Red Dead Redemption 2 can be played on PS5 and Xbox Series X via backward compatibility but has no current-gen enhancements.




This report also stated that a remaster of Red Dead Redemption had also been abandoned, and that was ultimately released in August 2023. Therefore, it&#39;s possible Red Dead Redemption 2 could still come to current-gen devices, which would certainly make for a good reveal in a showcase, although considering Rockstar&#39;s track record, this will likely be a full re-release like GTA 5, rather than the kind of upgrade patches seen in other titles such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt​​​​​​.






 A Rockstar Showcase Could Be A Good Way To Reveal GTA Online 2 
Or Updates To The Current GTA Online
         

Red Dead Online has been left behind by Rockstar after years of neglect, with the studio announcing no more major updates in 2022 despite backlash from its fanbase. However, its other major online title, GTA Online has been thriving. Since its launch in October 2013, GTA Online has received many updates such as Lowriders, Bikers, and Heists, with regular limited events designed to encourage players to return.

In recent years, GTA Online received more story-centric updates with returning characters such as Franklin in the Dr. Dre-starring &#34;The Contract&#34;, and Michael&#39;s therapist Dr. Friedlander returning as a drug lord almost a decade after the events of GTA 5&#39;s campaign in &#34;The Last Dose&#34;. There have also been reports from Tez2 (via Rockstar Intel), a respectable source for Rockstar news, that GTA Online could be receiving a new major update on December 12, although exactly what this contains has yet to be revealed.





 

Whether Rockstar Games opts to build upon its pre-existing version of GTA Online and add new locations and characters from GTA 6, or unveil a new GTA Online 2 that runs on the newer engine is yet to be seen. With rumors that GTA 6&#39;s story mode may also be releasing content episodically post-launch, future regular Rockstar Showcase events would certainly be a good way to keep players updated on what this new content entails.
