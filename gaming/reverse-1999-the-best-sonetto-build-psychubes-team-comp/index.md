## Literature Review

Sonetto may be F2P, but she is one of the best support characters in Reverse 1999 with excellent DPS and buff capabilities, fitting many team comps.





While F2P characters are typically weak, Sonetto is one of the best characters in Reverse 1999 as of global launch. While she may struggle in boss battles, her Incantations make her a top-tier support character. She can prevent strong enemies from attacking while boosting her team&#39;s damage, leading to a powerful Ultimate against all enemies.






If you want to get more Portrays for Sonetto, simply continue through the main story. Sonetto and all of her resources appear as rewards for story completion.





 The Best Psychubes For Sonetto 
         

The main goal associated with building Sonetto in Reverse 1999 is boosting her DPS capabilities. As Commandment V only targets one enemy at a time, Sonetto needs to make each hit count. As such, her best builds typically involve ATK Psychubes. There are four Psychubes that work well with Sonetto&#39;s consistent, single-target attacks and her Ultimate, Unrestricted Chant.

                  Genshin Impact 4.2: How To Get Freminet For Free   During Version 4.2, you will be able to obtain a free copy of Freminet in Genshin Impact. Hereâ€™s how to unlock the free 4-star Cryo character.    




The trick with using Sonetto effectively revolves around the interplay of Exhortation IV and Unrestricted Chant. If Sonetto casts Unrestricted Chant while she has a status boost or positive status (like the bonuses from Exhortation IV), her Penetration Rate and Realit Damage are greatly increased. Her Portrays increase the Penetration Rate even more, making Unrestricted Chant a game changer.

Like many DPS characters, Sonetto works well with Brave New World. This 6-Star Psychube can boost Sonetto&#39;s Ultimate Might by up to 18%. Brave New World can also increase the Incantation Might of Sonetto&#39;s next Incantation following her Ultimate by up to 40% when fully advanced. This can make Commandment V as deadly as Unrestricted Chant, wiping out whatever enemy comes across Sonetto&#39;s path.

If you&#39;d rather save Brave New World for a main DPS character, you could build Sonetto towards a sub-DPS with Her Second Life. Her Second Life is a Heal Psychube that provides a 10% ATK bonus when fully upgraded. With this Psychube equipped, Sonetto can heal the entire team after using her Ultimate.






The healing formula is Sonetto&#39;s HP &#43; (her ATK x 64%). If you don&#39;t have a good healer or shielder in Sonetto&#39;s team comps, Her Second Life can fill that space.




                  Zenless Zone Zero Feels Nothing Like Genshin Impact Or Honkai Star Rail (&amp; That&#39;s A Good Thing)   Zenless Zone Zero is soon to be the latest member of the HoYoverse family of games, and it&#39;s also the most different. That&#39;s a good thing.    

Don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t have either of these 6-Star Psychubes, as Sonetto can use some 5-Star Psychubes just as effectively! The Footloose is a go-to 5-Star Psychube for DPS characters. The Footloose can boost DMG Dealt by up to 16% if Sonetto targets someone with HP above 50%. While this bonus fades away when you get to the latter half of combat, it still has a use. The Footloose also provides a 15% Ultimate Might bonus, adding on to Sonetto&#39;s ridiculous Penetration Rate bonus for Unrestricted Chant.

The last Psychube that pairs well with Sonetto in Reverse 1999 is Her Bright Future. This 5-Star Psychube provides a humble DMG Bonus of 10% at Level 60. The main appeal of Her Bright Future is its addition to Sonetto&#39;s Ultimate. If Sonetto has a stat bonus when she activates Unrestricted Chant while equipped with Her Bright Future, her Ritual Might gets a 10% bonus. Her Bright Future can carry Sonetto through many of the difficult challenges that await her in Reverse 1999.






 Best Team Comps For Sonetto 
         

In your average Reverse 1999 team comp, you&#39;ll have a main DPS, a support dedicated to improving the DPS&#39;s capabilities, and a survival-oriented character, typically a healer or shielder. Sonetto takes up the support role in each of her team comps. Since Sonetto can Disarm opponents once she upgrades Commandment V, she can support survival characters who must pick and choose who to heal or debuff. Sonetto also works well with practically every good main DPS in the game.

Centurion is arguably the best DPS units players can pull as of Reverse 1999&#39;s global launch. Centurion&#39;s kit centers around keeping her Moxie high to fuel her powerful single-target attacks. Sonetto&#39;s buffs can improve Centurion&#39;s incredible DMG output by up to 25%. Even better, once she gets Insight 3, using her Ultimate and getting rid of Moxie will heal Centurion. Her ability to inflict Weakness on all enemies with her Ultimate is rendered a bit redundant with Sonetto&#39;s Disarm, but it can pick up the slack for enemies Sonetto isn&#39;t able to stun.




                  Honkai: Star Rail 1.6 - Every Confirmed Playable Character   Three new playable characters have been confirmed for Honkai: Star Rail 1.6, two of which are 5-star heroes. Here are more details about them.    

If you don&#39;t have Centurion, Regulus is an amazing alternate main DPS. Her Ultimate, Sleepless Rave, provides a positive status that can help trigger Sonetto&#39;s Ultimate bonus if she wasn&#39;t able to cast Exhortation IV. While she needs to rest every other round upon getting Insight 1 to utilize her incredible Crit Rate bonus, Sonetto can back her up. Her DMG is excellent and can only shine brighter with Sonetto&#39;s buffs.

When it comes to survival characters, it is hard to go wrong with Medicine Pocket. They debuff enemies by increasing their DMG Taken for one round. Mass heal can heal for up to 200% of their ATK and reduce DMG Taken when an enemy next attacks each character. They also pair well with Sonetto and Regulus as they can protect Regulus during their inactive rounds. Regardless of the team comp&#39;s main DPS, a well-built Medicine Pocket makes it hard for anyone on their team to die.




Dikke is another top-tier survival character, although she ranks slightly underneath Medicine Pocket. She still outshines most other healers, though. Her healing gets a bonus when it targets a teammate below 50% HP. She can also hold her own as she purifies any negative statuses with her Ultimate. Sonetto can encourage her combat capabilities while relying on her excellent healing.

The great thing about including Sonetto in a team comp is that she can hold her own in most situations. Even if you have some of the worst characters in the entire game, Sonetto can carry them to victory. Her position as a F2P character makes Reverse 1999 a great gacha game for F2P players.
