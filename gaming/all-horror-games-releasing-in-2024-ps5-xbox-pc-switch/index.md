## Literature Review

Following the strong horror game releases of the previous year, 2024 has a strong lineup of classic remakes and original releases to offer.




Although horror isn&#39;t the biggest or most prolific genre in gaming, 2024 is still looking to bring some major releases within the genre, with highly anticipated titles like The Last of Us Part II Remastered and the remake of Silent Hill 2 set to launch this year. Following the well-received horror remakes and sequels of 2023, which included games like Dead Space, Resident Evil 4, and Alan Wake II, 2024 is set to see the release of smaller original titles along the lines of Dredge and Amnesia: The Bunker, with genres ranging from more action-oriented survival horror titles to more exploration or text-based games.
Although some of 2024&#39;s upcoming horror games have received trailers showing story or gameplay, many of them still don&#39;t have hard confirmed release dates, with most titles past the first quarter set to release at undefined dates within the year. Some games, like Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game or S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, were originally announced for earlier releases in 2023 or even earlier but have since been delayed to undefined dates in 2024. Like with the action games of 2024, some of the year&#39;s releases could likely be newly announced closer to their actual releases.

 3  Every Horror Game Coming Out In Q1 2024 
Horror Games Releasing Between January 1 - March 31


 







Most of 2024&#39;s currently confirmed horror game release dates fall within the first quarter, including majorly popular or long-awaited titles like The Last of Us 2 Remastered, The Outlast Trials, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl. Notably, many of the horror games set to release within the first few months of the year are ports, remasters, or, in the case of Outlast Trials, a full release after a lengthy Early Access period, and others, particularly S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2, may face delays that would place them later in the year.
Likely the biggest release of the first quarter is The Last of Us Part II Remastered, which will bring the game to the PlayStation 5 along with enhanced visuals and a new roguelike game mode, No Return, which allows for a larger variety of playable characters than the main game. Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, is similar to The Last of Us in that it strays much closer to action with a horror aesthetic, but could still be a game to look out for, especially for those who are fans of developer Don&#39;t Nod&#39;s past work (Life Is Strange, Vampyr, Jusant).
The current list of horror games set to release in Q1 2024 is as follows:
  Game Title   Release Date   Platforms    Dreadout 2   January 18   Switch (port)    The Last of Us Part II Remastered   January 19   PS5    Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden   February 13   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    Spirit Hunter: Death Mark II   February 15   PC, Switch, PS5    The Outlast Trials   March 5   PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; X/S    Ib   March 14   PS4/5 (port)    Alone in the Dark   March 20   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl   Q1 2024   PC, Xbox Series X/S    





 2  Every Horror Game Coming Out In Q2 2024 
Horror Games Releasing Between April 1 - June 30


 







Past the first quarter of 2024, no horror games have yet received definitively confirmed release dates, with only two previously announced games potentially falling within the second quarter. The first, Post Trauma, is a third-person horror game from developer Red Soul Games that takes heavy inspiration from the classics of the genre. The few trailers currently released for the game show off a combination of puzzles, fixed camera angles, exploration, and combat that bears heavy similarities to classic Silent Hill and Resident Evil games. Currently, however, the game doesn&#39;t have a confirmed release date outside of Spring 2024.
Still Wakes the Deep, from developer The Chinese Room, is the second game set for an unconfirmed &#34;early 2024&#34; release date and takes the form of a first-person game about exploring a mysteriously wrecked oil rig. Unlike some of the other horror games set to release in 2024, Still Wake the Deep features no combat, leaning solely on exploration and survival, making it similar to some of The Chinese Room&#39;s previously released games, like Amnesia: Machine for Pigs and Dear Esther.
  Game Title   Release Date   Platforms    Post Trauma   Spring 2024   PC, Xbox, PlayStation (console generations unspecified)    Still Wakes the Deep   Early 2024   PC, Xbox Series X/S

 1  2024 Horror Games With Unconfirmed Release Dates 


 







No horror games so far have been confirmed for the latter half of 2024, with most currently announced games having unspecified 2024 release dates. This includes titles from major studios like Supermassive Games&#39; (Until Dawn, The Quarry) upcoming The Casting of Frank Stone, which was previously announced at the 2023 Game Awards, and the somewhat contentious Bloober Team (Layers of Fear, The Medium) remake of Silent Hill 2, along with several less-known titles like Dark Fracture and Hollowbody. Many of these games, especially those from smaller studios, currently have their console release statuses unconfirmed.
            
 
 Silent Hill 2 Remake Is Already In Trouble 
Bloober Team recently made an announcement that might concern Silent Hill 2 players, but does that mean the upcoming remake is in trouble?



Outside the higher-profile releases, Slitterhead may be interesting to Silent Hill fans - developed by Bokeh Game Studio, Slitterhead has the benefit of being worked on by the director and creator of the original Silent Hill, Keiichiro Toyama, and seems to feature similar third-person gameplay, albeit with a greater focus on action. Other games, like Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, however, are somewhat less promising, with Bloodlines 2 in particular having faced a notoriously difficult development cycle, which has caused the game to be heavily delayed from its original 2020 release date.
The following table lists the game with unconfirmed release dates releasing (or assumed to be releasing, in some cases) in 2024:
  Game Title   Platforms    The Bunny Graveyard   Switch    Bye Sweet Carole   PC, Switch, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S    The Casting of Frank Stone   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    Clock Tower   PC, Switch, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S    Dark Fracture   PC, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S    Hollowbody   PC    Infestation: Origins   PC    John Carpenter&#39;s Toxic Commando   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    Killer Klowns From Outer Space: The Game   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    Little Nightmares III   PC, Switch, PS4/5, Xbox One &amp; Series X/S    Paranormal Tales   PC    The Lost Wild   PC    Reveil   PC    Senua&#39;s Saga: Hellblade 2   PC, Xbox Series X/S    Silent Hill 2   PC, PS5    Slitterhead   PC    Tormented Souls 2   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S    Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2   PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S
