# Don t Buy From Scalpers, Wait Or Buy A PlayStation Portal Alternative Instead


## SUMMARY 



  The PlayStation Portal is a one-note gadget that allows PS5 owners to stream their console to a portable device, and there are already other devices that offer the same functionality at a better price point and with more versatility.   Alternative devices and third-party apps like PS Play offer a more flexible gaming experience compared to the PlayStation Portal, allowing players to use their own phones or controllers.   Dedicated Android portable consoles provide a better all-in-one option for gaming and emulation, offering more functionality and versatility than the PlayStation Portal at a lower price.

## Literature Review

The PlayStation Portal appears to be selling out as soon as it is stocked, but PS5 owners should pass on the Portal and look to better alternatives.




History repeated itself with the release of the PlayStation Portal, as the device sold out much like the initial release of the PlayStation 5, but PlayStation fans should buy a better device for console streaming instead of chasing restocks or falling prey to scalpers. The PlayStation Portal is a remarkably one-note gadget, allowing a PS5 owner to stream their console to the portable and play it away from the TV the PS5 is connected to. While the use cases are dubious for some, the bigger problem with the Portal is that there are already other devices that do the same thing, at a better price point, with far more versatility.




When it was revealed what the PlayStation Portal does, many noted that streaming a PS5 console to a portable device is already possible on modern mobile Android and iOS devices. The Portal’s form factor is essentially a split DualSense controller with a screen in between the two halves. This gives the Portal tactile controls which offer a far better experience than playing PS5 games using a touchscreen, but clip-on controllers for mobile phones have been available for some time. The official PS Remote Play app is remarkably finicky with the controllers it will accept, but the licensed Backbone One PlayStation Edition does work with the app.



The PlayStation Portal, as well as alternative devices for PS5 game streaming, are highly dependent on the user&#39;s internet connection, and work best on their home network.





 Cheaper PlayStation Portal Alternatives Still Offer More Functionality 
          




Playing a game using the Backbone and a mobile phone is every bit as comfortable as using an actual PS5 controller, and allows players to use the phone they already own. The Backbone features great controls, and notably allows consumers to do more than one thing, unlike the PlayStation Portal. It can be used with many Android or iOS games without the need for complex button mapping, as well as the various emulation apps available to Android owners. The Backbone is not the cheapest mobile add-on controller, retailing at $100 (though sale prices often see it drop to $70 or $75). The PS Play: Remote Play app expands options.


 

This $6 third-party app can stream a PS4 or PS5 to an Android device without the limits of the official PS Remote Play app. PS Play works as well as PS Remote Play, in terms of connection and image quality, but it pairs with nearly any controller, not just the Backbone One PlayStation Edition or an actual DualSense connected via Bluetooth. A PS5 owner can then use their Razer Kishi or Nacon MG-X Pro Android controller, or any other similar device, to play PS5 games remotely with quality tactile controls. Still, some players dislike having a controller that is attached to the device, instead of built in, like the Portal.






The third-party Chiaki application also allows for PlayStation 5 streaming play using the Steam Deck.




For consumers who want an all-in-one device, a dedicated Android portable console is still a better option than the PlayStation Portal. Android-based consoles like the Anbernic RG505 are primarily used for emulation and running Android games, but the PS Play third-party app can allow them to stream from a PS5 as well. These consoles are still cheaper than the PlayStation Portal but offer much more in terms of functionality and versatility. Those interested in higher-end gaming and emulation can look to options like the Ayn Odin, which is priced comparably to the Portal, or for the very best experience, more expensive options might be worthwhile.

                  You Should Be Worried About The PS5 Slim’s Detachable Disc Drive   The new slim PS5 all-digital model will pair with a Blu-Ray drive, but leaked information suggests it will require an internet connection for use.   






 An Android Phone Or Console Can Stream PS5 &amp; Play Offline Games 
          

The Ayn Odin 2, the Aya Neo Pocket Air, and the Pimax Portal Retro all offer top-tier Android specs, granting them all the gaming options available on a high-end phone, including the ability to play PS5 via streaming. These consoles can run Android games like Diablo Immortal, push the limits of Android emulation, and more, instead of solely streaming PS5. If a PlayStation fan really wants a device solely for PS5 streaming, a lower end Android portable from Anbernic, or a controller attached to a refurbished Android phone, can deliver that easily, and still play offline games. PS5 streaming is highly dependent on internet connection, not device specs.

Where the PlayStation Vita could stream the PS4, along with running its own game library, the PlayStation Portal is niche and limited to an absurd degree. Scalpers may have thought it was the next PS5, and intend to resale the devices at a markup, but PlayStation 5 fans are better off passing on the Portal and looking to one of the many alternatives that can do more than one thing, often at a much cheaper price point.
