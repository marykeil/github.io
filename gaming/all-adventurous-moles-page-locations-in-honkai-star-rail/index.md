## Literature Review

One of the missions you can follow in Honkai: Star Rail has you track down all the pages to a book called Adventurous Moles for rewards from puzzles.





To unlock the &#34;Adventurous Moles&#34; mission, you first have to complete two other Companion Quests called &#34;Old Foreman&#39;s Treasure&#34; and &#34;Hook&#39;s Treasure.&#34; You also need to defeat the main boss of Jarilo-VI by pursuing &#34;The Return&#34; quest tied to Honkai: Star Rail&#39;s main story. Only then will you be able to meet up with the NPC Julian, a young boy found in Boulder Town who tells you about the missing pages when you talk to him.




                  Honkai: Star Rail 1.5 Livestream - Date, Time &amp; What To Expect   The livestream for Honkai: Star Rail 1.5 was officially announced by HoYoverse. Here’s how to watch it and what to expect from the special event.   


 The Missing Miner&#39;s Lamp 
          

There are four secret pages according to Julian, each scattered around different areas with their own puzzles for you to solve. The first page location is given for free by the young boy and his friends in the Moles Adventure Squad, pointing you toward a place called the Great Mine. Thankfully, you don&#39;t have to worry about using your camera to scan any QR Codes within Photo Mode in Honkai: Star Rail at any of these spots.

Your search starts in an area marked in a yellow circle on your map, giving you a good idea of where the page will likely be. Travel to the place indicated by the quest to spot the page on top of a barrel next to a crate filled with gold in Honkai: Star Rail. Picking up the parchment shows you a short story titled &#34;The Missing Miner&#39;s Lamp,&#34; which acts as your first clue toward unlocking a Bountiful Treasure Chest in the area.






There are multiple enemies guarding sections of the Great Mine, so make sure you have a team with a good party composition to take on these threats as they appear.




Another area in yellow appears as you grab the book page, leading you a short distance into a section of the Mine with the lamp on top of a crate. Next to the crate are four fences blocking a series of pipes in the wall. You may notice that each pipe has a Miner&#39;s Lamp on top of it, except for one. Based on the clue you collected, the solution to this puzzle is to place the Miner&#39;s Lamp on the empty pipe section.

                  Everything Honkai: Star Rail Does Better Than Genshin Impact   As the first game released by HoYoverse after the massive success of Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail improves on the earlier game in a few ways.   



 The Crates Are the Keys 
          




Go back to Julian once you collect your rewards from the chest unveiled from the first puzzle in the Great Mine. He&#39;ll ask you to find the rest of the pages using the remaining clues found in the book&#39;s Table of Contents, giving you three more areas to visit in Honkai: Star Rail. The easiest one to reach first is Rivet Town, specifically in the Abandoned Market section to the northwest of the zone.



One of the best ways to travel to the other page locations is to use Space Anchors in different zones, which act as fast travel points for your team.




You&#39;ll find the puzzle hint &#34;The Crates Are the Keys&#34; on a table to your right in a secluded room within the Market once you travel there. Like the message of this puzzle suggests, the crates in this space are connected in Honkai: Star Rail. Go to the shelf on your left with four crates on it, then take the box from the top. The goal here is to actually make both shelves in the room have the same number of crates in the same positions.




Move to the shelf on your right and place the crate you took on the middle platform of the structure to solve the puzzle here. If you do this right, a short cutscene will play with another Bountiful Chest appearing in the room with rewards for your efforts. Some of the items you will receive here are Stellar Jade in Honkai: Star Rail, a valuable premium currency.



 The Unexpected Parchment 
          

The next page can be found at Backwater Pass, a more commercial location where you have to find a café nestled in the southeast region of the zone. The clue page can be grabbed from one of the benches in the area right before you reach the small store in Honkai: Star Rail. Much like the other Table of Content pieces you&#39;ve found so far, &#34;The Unexpected Parchment&#34; story told on the page will give you clues about what to do.




This puzzle is fairly straightforward, with the only task involving the many chairs sitting around the café. All you need to do is go up to the chair flipped upside down on top of the table and lift the seat to solve the puzzle and reveal yet another Bountiful Chest. Since there are no other flipped chairs in the area, you should be able to recognize the right object to interact with right away in Honkai: Star Rail.



Make sure to choose the &#34;lay it flat on the ground&#34; option when trying to maneuver the chair at the Backwater Pass café. Placing it upside down on the table will not solve the puzzle here.






 Treasure Hunt on the Battlefield 
          

The final &#34;Adventurous Moles&#34; page puzzle is located at the Silvermane Guard Restricted Zone, in the Frontline section close to the area&#39;s Space Anchor. The Table of Contents parchment is attached to the wall right at the beginning of the region and contains the &#34;Treasure Hunt on the Battlefield&#34; story, much like the others. Your quest marker gives a hint here, asking you to focus on the scattered weapons here in Honkai: Star Rail.




Your objective in this area is to go to the four gun racks around the Frontline that do not have three rifles organized into them. A spare gun should be close to each of these racks that you must pick up and place back where they are supposed to go in Honkai: Star Rail. The gun racks are found in all four corners of this small space, making this task fairly easy once you understand your goal.

Arranging every gun reveals a final Bountiful Chest, solving the puzzle and letting you return to Julian to finish the quest. Once you find all the page locations and figure out their riddles in Honkai: Star Rail, you&#39;ll receive 100 Trailblaze EXP, 30 Stellar Jade, 100 Shield, 8 Sparse Aether, and 8,000 Credits for finishing the &#34;Adventurous Moles&#34; mission.
