## Literature Review

The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria is chock-full of resources to acquire, but some stand out as the most important focus to ensure success.




Resource management plays a critical role in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, and keeping an eye on the most essential ones is the best way to keep pace with everything the game demands. As a survival crafting experience, progression hinges on collecting the necessary components and ingredients to craft equipment, build bases, and stay supplied with basics like food. Supplies that are both plentiful in supply and niche in application are easy to keep on hand, but others can bleed dry at the most inconvenient moments.
The balance of some supplies can also depend on any individual playthrough, as there&#39;s plenty of flex in how each game shakes out. Different seeds for the procedurally generated world could spawn more of certain ores in convenient locations, and taking on an adventure with seven companions will burn through more food and equipment than going it alone. Consequently, there&#39;s no way to guarantee what resources are going to be a struggle, but a certain selection is the most likely to crop up as necessary, regardless of any outside factors.
            
 
 The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria 
It&#39;s not exactly mithril, but there&#39;s still some solid ore to be found for Dwarves of more modest ambition in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.













 








 10  Natural Fiber (Rope Ladders) 
Arachnid Lairs
        

Many of the giant spiders that haunt fantasy caves trace their lineage back to Tolkien&#39;s creations, and The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria isn&#39;t shy about deploying arachnids. Killing them can offer a big benefit, however, as any spider lair will surely be a great source of Natural Fiber. Alternately, they can be found in abandoned structures and supplies left behind by Dwarves who abandoned the mines long ago. Natural Fiber can be used to construct platforms with rope ladders, which are an essential tool for efficiently navigating environments with verticality.





 9  Resin (Hide &amp; Kitchen Equipment) 
Lower Deeps Deposits
        

Resin can be found in the Lower Deeps in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, appearing as an orange ore that can be found in standard veins. Resin doesn&#39;t quite rank among the top echelon of critical ores in the game, but it can solve a few problems in camp once it&#39;s found. A big one is using it to turn hide scraps into hide on the loom, which can provide a much readier supply of the resource than the limited amount of animals who drop proper hide. It&#39;s also a necessary component of building a Roasting Pit, Tiled Hearth, or Alchemical Still.

LOTR: Return to Moria is due to debut later this month, leaving many PC players wondering if a Steam launch is in the cards for the game.









 8  Bat Droppings (Farming Boxes) 
Defeated Bats
        

It might not seem appealing to pick up Bat Droppings to bring them into a The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria camp, but it&#39;s certainly worth doing. Along with Ihraz Granite, Bat Droppings are necessary to set up a farm to grow crops. Trying to keep a party of Dwarves supplied with food only through hunting and gathering can be difficult, so getting some Bat Droppings to set up a more permanent supply of ingredients is something that will become imperative sooner or later.





 7  Ihraz Granite (Statues) 
Lower Deeps Deposits


 







It&#39;s easy for Ihraz Granite to end up being a progression bottleneck in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, as this resource will suddenly become a key crafting component midway through the game. Venturing to the depths eventually makes it readily available, however, as it replaces stone as the excess material in many deposits of more valuable materials. Outside of its status as a basic building block for crafting many items, Ihraz Granite replaces stone as the necessary ingredient for repairing statues, which is important for unlocking new recipes.

 6  Mithril (High-End Tools) 
Mithril Mine Shaft In The Darkest Deeps
        

In a game about Tolkien&#39;s Dwarves, it&#39;s no surprise that Mithril is ultimately a must. This rarest of metals can make the most valuable ingots in the game, which can be smelted in Great Forges and Ufahan Furnaces. That being said, Mithril doesn&#39;t become relevant until late in the game, when it becomes obtainable through dragon scales. Despite its iconic status, it&#39;s consequently hard to argue that it&#39;s as overarchingly essential as some ores that are in more common supply.





 5  Elven Wood (Tier 2 Equipment) 
Elven Quarter Trees
        

It isn&#39;t necessary to spend all that much time on the first passthrough of the Elven Quarter, but it will quickly become obvious that bouncing back up to the lush environment is crucial to keeping a steady supply of resources on hand. In addition to a plentiful array of beasts to hunt for hide and meat, the Elven Quarter features forestation that acts as a primary source for Elven Wood. It helps to remember that most Dwarves will always need more Elven Wood than they think, as this resource can burn through quickly thanks to its many applications.

One of the most important resources to get in LOTR: Return to Moria is Elven Wood, which can be used to craft various upgrades and important tools.









 4  Ubasam Wood (First Age Pickaxe) 
Lower Deeps Mushrooms


 







It&#39;s easy to understand how to acquire Elven Wood, but its (sort-of) successor Ubasam Wood, can be downright mystifying. Rather than being supplied by trees, Ubasam Wood comes from fungi that can be found in the Lower Deeps, making it all too possible to be completely stymied on how to acquire it. Like Elven Wood, Ubasam starts seeing plenty of use in miscellaneous recipes around the point where it becomes available in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria.





 3  Metal Fragments (Repairs) 
Defeated Orcs &amp; Broken Barrels
        

Metal Fragments aren&#39;t hard to find in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria, as enemy orcs and innocent barrels alike drop them aplenty. Nonetheless, it&#39;s hard to argue that they aren&#39;t one of the most important resources in the game. Metal Fragments can be used to repair equipment, and considering how quickly enemies chew through armor, keeping a steady supply on hand can save quite a lot on the more valuable materials that would be required to make replacements.
Wood Scraps are a similarly critical resource, but it&#39;s even harder to end up with a deficit than it is with Metal Fragments (unless using it to manufacture Coal). 






 2  Black Diamond (Map Stones) 
Orc Chests


 







Black Diamond can&#39;t be found as easily as many The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria resources, with the simplest method of acquiring it coming from clearing out Orc camps to loot the chests within. As the primary resource for crafting Map Stones that allow fast travel, however, stocking up can offer a lot of extra convenience. 20 Black Diamonds are also required to repair major progression gates like the Mine Hoist and Eastern Stairs, so slacking on this resource will leave a Dwarf completely stuck.

Black Diamonds are a valuable resource in The Lord of the Rings: Mines of Moira that serve three important purposes to progressing your game.









 1  Coal (Fuel &amp; Ingots) 
General Deposits
        

Coal might just be the most important Return to Moria resource, with a variety of essential uses that far outstrip the basic applications of most minerals. Using it as a reliable fuel source burns through minor quantities regularly, while its status as a crafting ingredient for essentials like steel ore can take larger quantities. It&#39;s easy to feel like leaving a little behind early on, but gathering all the Coal that can be found in The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria will definitely prove useful in the long run.
