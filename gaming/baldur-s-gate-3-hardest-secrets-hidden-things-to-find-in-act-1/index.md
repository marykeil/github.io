## Literature Review

Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 encourages thorough exploration and multiple playthroughs in order to discover everything hidden throughout its world.




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 takes place over a century after the events of Baldur&#39;s Gate 2, where evil forces are threatening the world once again. The protagonist is infected with a mind flayer tadpole parasite and must work together with a number of companions to find a cure before they transform entirely. Act One of the game was available throughout its early access period, providing more opportunities for its depths to be combed for secrets and surprises, but even more have been added since its full release. Hidden quests dependent on characters&#39; wrongdoings, trap doors, and loot caches are all possible to find in the starting segment of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.

                  Baldur&#39;s Gate 3: 8 Hardest Secrets &amp; Hidden Things To Find In Act 2   There are so many hidden secrets, items, and quests tucked away in the Shadowlands of Act Two in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 for players to discover.   


 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Secret Room In the Crypt 
Find Withers, The Watcher&#39;s Guide, And The Amulet Of Lost Voices
         




Larian is fond of hiding secret rooms, messages, and loot around its games&#39; expansive worlds, and Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is no exception. Located within the crypt that Shadowheart may point out if she&#39;s in the party, a secret trigger point can be found at X: -289, Y: -230. Investigating the wall makes it possible to enter a hidden area, which houses a sarcophagus that can initiate a conversation with the Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 party.

Sticking to friendly options will earn the party some loot: The Watcher&#39;s Guide spear and The Amulet of Lost Voices. The Watcher&#39;s Guide provides 1d8 piercing damage and imbues the wielder with the Rush ability and Death&#39;s Promise. They can also meet Withers here, a mysterious character who allows players to respec in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.



 Recruiting An Owlbear Cub In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 
Gain A Feathered Friend By Exploring A Hidden Cave
          




The Owlbear Cave is located within the first area of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, hidden beyond Druid Grove and the tieflings’ camp. Following the path along the river leads the party to a cave, though they may meet victims of an owlbear attack along the way. A fully grown owlbear, replete with cubs and a nest egg is hidden inside the cave. If the party alerts her, she can quickly become aggressive. Those with the speak with animals spell or a lucky Animal Handling check can interact with the owlbear to escape the situation swiftly, but anyone else will have to fight.

After a long rest, the owlbear cub will flee and be captured by the goblins set up in a nearby camp. The goblins have a so-called “chicken-chasing” game, which requires a participant interested in getting the owlbear cub in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 to successfully navigate a maze. The cub can also be purchased outright for 500 gold, although this sum might set a character back in Act One. Afterward, the owlbear cub will appear at the camp and interact with the protagonist, companions, or Scratch the dog. Unfortunately, the cub won&#39;t fight alongside the party until the very end of the game, but he&#39;s a cute little companion to have.




                  Should You Sell Or Keep The Owlbear Egg In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3?   In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, there are many hard decisions that adventurers have to make, but whether or not to sell an owlbear egg shouldn&#39;t be one of them.    



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Owlbear Cave Has Amazing Loot 
Find The Oak Father&#39;s Embrace, An Idol Of Selune, And The Moondrop Pendant
          

Aside from initiating the owlbear recruitment in the Owlbear Cave, perceptive characters can also gather a powerful piece of armor hidden close by. Knocking out the owlbear mother, or simply returning after the goblins have done so, can allow parties to loot the cave without the threat of being attacked. The owlbear mother and the cave&#39;s terrain can inflict nasty damage to unprepared parties, but the loot within (and the subsequent companion quest) provides plenty of reasons to see the encounter through. These goods can be found both through general exploration and by tackling a puzzle within the cave.




The Oak Father&#39;s Embrace is a piece of medium armor that provides the Order of Nature buff, making undead enemies attacking the wearer take 1d6 Radiant damage, while beasts that attack the wearer gain an extra 1d6 Radiant damage against their target. Solving the statue of Selune puzzle in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and opening the gilded chest provides another selection of earnings, most notably an Idol of Selune and a Moondrop Pendant that can reduce triggers for opportunity attacks in combat.



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Blighted Village Holds Some Secrets 
Find The Warped Headband Of Intelligence, Lump&#39;s War Horn, The Necromancy Of Thay, And Qasit
          

A house in the Blighted Village contains three orcs guarding precious loot. Parties with the health (and spell slots) to spare should confront a set of three orcs inside a ruined house to acquire the Warped Headband of Intelligence. This item boosts the wearer&#39;s intelligence stat to 17, which can assist in conversations, exploration, and combat, becoming one of the most powerful items available in Act One of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. But if Tav decides instead to schmooze with the orcs, they&#39;ll instead give them Lump&#39;s War Horn. This can be used to summon the orcs in battle, but be warned - they&#39;ll try to eat anything in their path.




                  How to Finish the Masterwork Weapon in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3   One of the rarest weapons to create in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the Masterwork Weapon, a special tool that you can finish as part of a side quest in Act 1.   

Another key secret in the Blighted Village lies in a cellar, which can be found underneath the Apothecary. The door to a secret section of the cellar is hidden behind a bookcase, and the lever to move that bookcase is likewise masked by a pile of crates. Navigating a conversation with a magic mirror is the last major challenge before finding a rare tome called The Necromancy of Thay. It takes the rest of the game to read The Necromancy of Thay, but this is the only chance to find it. The party can also find a Scroll of Summoning Qasit, which they may read to gain a new familiar.



 The Phase Spider Matriarch Is A Hidden Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Encounter 
Fight A Powerful Boss And Loot The Spiderstep Boots, Poisonous Robe, And Dark Amethyst
          




Baldur&#39;s Gate 3&#39;s Phase Spider Matriarch is a difficult (and rewarding) boss located in a mini-dungeon hidden at the bottom of the Blighted Village&#39;s Well. Fighting through spiders and other underground beasts leads to a teleporting spider boss, accompanied by minions and able to summon a number of fresh hatchlings.

While this encounter is difficult, it also leads to fantastic loot, including Spiderstep Boots, the Poisoner&#39;s Robe, and a Dark Amethyst. The Spiderstep Boots prevent characters from becoming Enwebbed, while the Poisoner&#39;s Robe deals an extra 1d4 Poison damage for poisonous spells. The amethyst can be used to open The Necromancy of Thay and read its first few chapters to gain speak with dead and a slight buff to Wisdom.



 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Rewards Non-Lethal Combat 
Sometimes It&#39;s Best To Leave Enemies Alive
         




The default settings for Baldur’s Gate 3 leave all combat as lethal, so the last blow will always be a killing one. While this is an efficient method to clear the world for unhampered exploration, it also blocks off loot and opportunities. Traders and merchants provide more gold and items if knocked unconscious rather than killed. Additionally, not killing enemies or NPCs opens the opportunity to interact with them again later. An example of this mechanic is the outraged human adventurer in front of the gates to Druid Grove. His anger (depending on choices) can result in some entertaining dialogue, but he can also point toward a powerful hidden artifact.

While Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 offers a thrilling storyline and exploration, locating the hidden details also presents an entertaining pastime while exploring the world. Ensuring that no stone can go unturned without leaving powerful weapons, armor, or hidden cutscenes behind is an excellent way to increase the game&#39;s replayability. Act One is only the beginning of the game&#39;s secrets, but it has plenty to offer in reward for thorough searches. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is nothing if not expansive, and the sense of discovery around every corner plays a huge part in making this rewarding.
