## Literature Review

Despite the large quantity of conflicting information, it seems like Xianyun’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact has leaked ahead of Version 4.4.




Most of Xianyun’s gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.4 has allegedly been leaked, even if there are still a few specifics that are being worked on by the developer, HoYoverse. This includes her Vision, weapon type, abilities, and even passive Talents and Constellations. The human form of Cloud Retainer, the crane-like adepti of the region of Liyue, made her debut as an NPC in an animated cutscene during 2023’s Lantern Rite Festival event. Now, a year later, the character has been confirmed as an upcoming playable character in Version 4.4. Xianyun is one of the new characters in the next patch, along with the 4-star Pyro unit, Gaming.




Xianyun will be included in the Phase 1 banners for Genshin Impact 4.4, according to the leaks. That information, however, remains to be confirmed by official sources. The human form of Cloud Retainer is said to be a sub-DPS and support unit, capable of dealing off-field damage and providing healing to party members. Because of how she allegedly operates, she can be a great match with some characters, like Xiao. This seems fitting, considering Xiao’s leaked rerun in Genshin Impact 4.4. Most of Xianyun’s gameplay kit has leaked, so it is possible to get a better understanding of what this character may end up being once she is officially released.

                  Genshin Impact 4.5 Leaks Reveal New Banner Characters   Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.   


 Xianyun’s Vision &amp; Weapon Type In Genshin Impact 4.4 
         




According to a compilation of Xianyun-related leaks, posted by the user HomDGCat on Reddit, the new 5-star unit from Liyue will have an Anemo Vision. This was already confirmed by the developer in a post made on the official Genshin Impact profile on X. According to the leaks, however, Xianyun will use a catalyst in battle, which will allow her to apply Anemo with her Normal and Charged Attacks. According to another post by HomDGCat on Reddit, her signature 5-star catalyst is called Crane’s Echoing Call, which is represented by a green and adorned hand fan.



As is the case with any leaks, the information provided by HomDGCat should be taken with a grain of salt. The leaks may be inaccurate or simply outdated. In Xianyun’s case, specifically, there has been a lot of conflicting information circulating when it comes to the specifics provided by her abilities, so it is best to wait for an official confirmation by HoYoverse.






 Xianyun’s Normal &amp; Charged Attacks In Genshin Impact 
          




Xianyun’s Normal, Charged, and Plunging Attacks are not too out of the ordinary, according to the leaks provided by HomDGCat. The post mentions that Xianyun’s Normal Attacks, which fall under the title Word Of Wind And Flower, summon swirling winds at the enemy’s location, for up to a 4-attack combo that deals Anemo DMG with every hit – this is made possible due to her usage of a catalyst as a weapon in Genshin Impact. Her Charged Attack, on the other hand, will consume some Stamina to launch a Breeze Bolt in a straight line forward, dealing Anemo DMG to those it hits.

The Plunging Attack used by Xianyun is also similar to other Anemo units in the game. When attacking while in the air, Xianyun gathers Anemo around her and plunges, creating a small Anemo AoE (area of effect) that deals elemental damage to opponents hit by the attack. While the regular form of the Plunging Attack is not too distinct, the Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks do indicate that she will have a special Plunging Attack, which will be at the core of her gameplay loop.






 Xianyun’s Elemental Skill In Genshin Impact 
          

According to the leaks, Xianyun’s Elemental Skill is called White Clouds At Dawn. When used, this ability sets Xianyun into the Cloud Transmogrification state, in which she cannot take damage from falling, and allows her to use Skyladder once. Within this state, her regular Plunging Attack will be transformed into Driftcloud Wave, which deals AoE Anemo DMG and ends the Cloud Transmogrification state in Genshin Impact. The damage used by this attack is considered Plunging Attack DMG. The DMG and AoE of Driftcloud Wave are increased by each use of Skyladder while in Xianyun’s Cloud Transmogrification state.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Team Comps May Get A Massive Overhaul   One new Genshin Impact 4.4 leak points toward a great quality-of-life improvement that will affect how players structure their team comps.   




Skyladder can be activated while in midair. This special ability makes her leap forward and deals Anemo DMG to those in the Skyladder’s path. With every Cloud Transmogrification state, Xianyun can activate Skyladder up to three times, yet only one instance of Skyladder DMG can be dealt to any one opponent. If Skyladder is not activated shortly after another, the Cloud Transmogrification state used by Xianyun in Genshin Impact will be canceled, thus making it impossible to use her Driftcloud Wave. It seems like the core idea of Xianyun’s Elemental Skill is to quickly jump into the air with all three Skyladders and attack with Cloud Transmogrification’s Driftcloud Wave.



The leaks indicate that this Skill’s Cooldown is 12 seconds.






 Xianyun’s Elemental Burst In Genshin Impact 
          




Xianyun’s Elemental Burst may be a crucial part of her gameplay kit, according to the leaks. Named Stars Gather At Dusk, Xianyun’s Burst creates an AoE of Anemo DMG and periodically heals nearby characters based on Xianyun’s ATK stat. Using the Burst also triggers Starwicker. The healing provided by Xianyun’s Elemental Burst in Genshin Impact is said to follow the player’s active character, much like Barbara’s Elemental Skill in some ways. The Burst also grants players 8 stacks of Adeptal Assistance, a buff that increases the nearby active characters’ jump height.

Once an active character uses their Plunging Attack, the Starwicker mechanism will consume 1 stack of Adeptal Assistance and deal an instance of AoE Anemo DMG. Only one Starwicker can exist at a time. The Genshin Impact 4.4 leaks indicate that Xianyun’s Elemental Burst lasts for 16 seconds, has an 18-second cooldown and has an Energy Cost of 70 points.

                  New Genshin Impact Leak May Be Bad News For One Long-Awaited Character   Amidst the exciting new Genshin Impact leaks, one bit of information may actually be upsetting for players expecting a long-awaited character.   






The Elemental Burst used by Xianyun is, allegedly, one of the reasons why she will be a good match for Xiao. While he does not need extra jump height with his Elemental Burst, he does thrive on dealing damage through Plunging Attacks, so that can keep him going even outside his Burst. The Anemo Resonance activated by pairing them up can also be beneficial to the team comp.






 Xianyun’s Passive Abilities In Genshin Impact 
          

Xianyun, like all other characters in the game, is expected to have three Passive Talents that are unlocked as players go through her Ascension thresholds while in the process of leveling her. The leaks mention that one of her Passive abilities is called Galefeather Pursuit and, with each opponent hit by Xianyun’s Driftcloud Waves, all nearby party members will gain 1 stack of Storm Pinion for 20 seconds, for up to 4 stacks. Each of these stacks has an independent duration and will cause the characters’ Plunging Attack CRIT Rate in Genshin Impact to increase by 4%/6%/8%/10%, respectively.




The second Passive Talent leaked is called Consider, The Adeptus In Her Realm. This ability sees that when the Starwicker created by Xianyun’s Burst has Adeptal Assistance stacks, nearby active characters’ Plunging Attack shockwave DMG will increase by 180% of Xianyun’s ATK – the maximum DMG increase allowed through this method is 9,000. This augmented DMG effect can only be applied to a single opponent, and can only be triggered every 0.4 seconds. Xianyun’s last Passive Talent in Genshin Impact is called Crane Form, and it increases the party’s gliding SPD by 15%, an effect that cannot be stacked with other buffs of the same kind.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: New Skins May Be The Most Beautiful So Far   According to leaks, Genshin Impact will introduce two new skins in Version 4.4 - and they have the potential to be the most beautiful ones so far.   



 Xianyun’s Constellations In Genshin Impact 
          




Xianyun’s Constellations are also featured in the Version 4.4 leaks. Her C1 is called Purifying Wind, and it gives her Elemental Skill an extra charge. C2 is Aloof From The World and, after using a Skyladder, Xianyun’s ATK is increased by 20% for 15 seconds. Her second Constellation also doubles the offensive boost provided by her Consider, The Adeptus In Her Realm Passive Talent, for a DMG bonus of up to 18,000. Xianyun’s C3 in Genshin Impact boosts her Elemental Burst’s level by 3, with the upgrade cap level increased to 15.

C4 will add healing to Xianyun’s Driftcloud Wave, based on the number of times her Skyladder was used in a single Cloud Transmogrification state, and it will scale off her ATK stat. Xianyun’s fifth Constellation will boost her Skill by 3 and increase the upgrade level to 15. C6 will increase Driftcloud Wave’s CRIT DMG based on the number of times she used Skyladders in a single Cloud Transmogrification instance. Additionally, C6 sees that within 16 seconds after Xianyun uses her Burst, her Elemental Skill will not enter the cooldown, an effect that is canceled after she uses her Skill 8 times.




                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: Free Skin Offer May Be Better Than You Think   Genshin Impact players may finally be getting some generous treatment in Version 4.4 with the arrival of a surprising though limited tool.   

It is important to reiterate that Xianyun’s abilities are still subject to change ahead of her official release in Version 4.4. Nevertheless, it does seem like she is shaping up to be a decent support and sub-DPS unit, even if her skill set somewhat limits her to being paired up with characters that thrive on Plunging DMG in Genshin Impact.
