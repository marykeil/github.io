## Literature Review

If you want to complete the Slice &amp; Dice Challenge in Bitlife, players will have to live a life of crime that putsÂ some blood on your hands.





Unfortunately, you must own the Black Market expansion pack to complete the Slice and Dice challenge in BitLife. This will allow you to buy weapons from an arms dealer in-game, which is required to complete the tasks tied to the challenge. This same instance can be found with becoming an Astronaut in BitLife, as you must buy the Astronaut Special Career Pack to pursue the profession.






BitLife Weekly Challenges reset every Saturday at 2 PM CT. However, buying the Challenge Vault add-on will give you access to all the past weekly challenges.





 How To Finish The Slice &amp; Dice Challenge In BitLife 
          

There are five tasks you need to do in order to complete the Slide &amp; Dice Challenge:

  Be born a male in Texas   Purchase 5&#43; weapons from the arms dealer   Attack 5&#43; individuals with weapons you&#39;ve purchased   Murder someone with a Katana   Sell a murder weapon  

How to Be Born A Male in Texas
Because you must be a male born in Texas to complete this challenge, you will likely need to start a new life. Of course, choose to be a male in the United States. Then, choose either Austin, Houston, Dallas, or San Antonio as your residence to be born in Texas.






If you have the Crime Job Pack, choose the Crime Special Talent, as it will make it much easier to complete the third and fourth tasks.




How To Purchase Weapons From The Arms Dealer
You must wait until your character is an adult, which is 18 years old before you can access the Arms Dealer. Once you&#39;ve reached adulthood, go to the Activities tab and choose Black Market. From here, choose Arms Dealer to view the available weapons for purchase. Some weapons can be bought, whereas others require you to bid on them against other buyers. You can even haggle with the arms dealer for a lower price, but it&#39;s in your best interest not to.

You need to purchase at least six weapons from the arms dealer for the Slice &amp; Dice Challenge. Furthermore, one of them must be the Katana. If you can&#39;t find the Katana, simply select &#34;Keep Looking&#34; until it appears (This may require you to age). Nonetheless, buying all of these weapons will be expensive, so it&#39;s best if you pursue a high-paying career, such as becoming a lawyer in BitLife.




How to Attack NPCs With Purchased Weapons
Once you have bought at least six weapons from the arms dealer, one being the Katana, you will need to put them to use. More specifically, you must attack at least six people with the weapons you have purchased. This is possible in the arms dealer shop, as you can attack when someone is bidding against you for a weapon. It doesn&#39;t matter what weapon you use to attack, but it&#39;s best to always use the Katana if your attack kills the person.

How To Kill Someone With a Katana
If you still need to kill someone with a Katana after attacking five or more people, you can easily do so by going to the Activities tab and selecting the Crime menu. You can choose to murder someone in this tab. First, choose the victim, then the murder weapon, which should be your Katana.

How to Sell a Murder Weapon
The final task needed to complete the Slice &amp; Dice Challenge in BitLife is to sell a murder weapon, being your Katana. To do this, go to Assets, Belongings, and then select the Katana as your murder weapon. You will first need to get it appraised before you can sell it. But, as soon as the Katana is sold, you will complete the Slice &amp; Dice Challenge in BitLife.
