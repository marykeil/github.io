# 10 Zelda TOTK Shrines That Should Have Been Longer


## SUMMARY 


 Some shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom could have been longer and more challenging, such as the Jiosin Shrine and Tajikats Shrine. 
 The Combat Training shrines, like Eshos Shrine and Kyononis Shrine, teach basic combat skills but could have been more entertaining with additional puzzles. 
 The Mayahisik Shrine and Zanmik Shrine have missed opportunities for more engaging gameplay and could have had more creative puzzles to solve.

## Literature Review

Some of the shrines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom are fun and challenging, but others can feel as though they are a bit lacking.




Both The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and its predecessor, Breath of the Wild, have many creative and challenging puzzles for Link to try his hand at inside the shrines throughout Hyrule. These shrines offer ways for new skills to be introduced to players and take the place of some of the game mechanics that were handled by dungeons in other entries in the series. While dungeons would give a much larger and more involved place for these abilities to be used, the shrines are often designed to be very short examples to show how Link can utilize that skill in the overworld.
Many of TOTK&#39;s shrines can be engaging and challenging and offer unique puzzles to solve. Out of 152 shrines that are scattered around the world on land and in the sky islands, there are naturally going to be some that are more entertaining than others. Some shrines end up feeling a bit rushed, and as though there could have been much more done with what they were attempting. Here are ten examples of shrines in TOTK that needed to be a little longer and have a bit more added to them.

 10  Jiosin Shrine 
Shape Rotation
        

The Jiosin Shrine in Zelda: TOTK is located in the Central Hyrule Region and is designed to help teach players about how to rotate and manipulate objects using the Ultrahand ability. As frequently as Ultrahand needs to be used in the game, this is a good skill to practice, yet it feels as though more could have been done with it. The shrine feels somewhat reminiscent of the classic toddler toy activity of fitting shapes into their corresponding holes, and although it is a rewarding feeling to accomplish it, the concept could have been applied more impressively.





 9  Tajikats Shrine 
Building With Logs


 







Another shrine that helps teach players what they can do with the Ultrahand is Tajikats Shrine, where Link must build with logs to get to the treasure chests. Building boats and using objects to overcome challenging obstacles is a very common feature in TOTK and Tajikats Shrine works well to help encourage people to think of ways to use the items they can find. Unfortunately, by the time this shrine is encountered, this is not a novel concept, and, likely, these skills have already been learned.





 8  Teniten Shrine 
Combat Training: Throwing
        

As the title of the Teniten Shrine clearly states, the object here is to master the skill of throwing items. There is one Zonai Construct present on a raised platform and some rusty halberds available to throw at it. This simple activity is all that there is to complete this shrine, which is unfortunate. The act of throwing things, especially weapons, could have been used in many other fun and clever ways.

 7  Eshos Shrine 
Combat Training: Shields


 







Combat Training shrines in Zelda: TOTK are useful for teaching players how to successfully fight and defend themselves. The Eshos Shrine is focused specifically on Combat Training: Shields to learn how to best defend Link from attacks using his trusty shield. It is incredibly straightforward, showing how different elemental projectiles can be blocked with specific shields, such as using metal rather than a wood shield against fire. The simplicity of the ideas could have been more entertaining with additional puzzles, however, such as a short lesson on how to use the shield as a sled.





 6  Mayahisik Shrine 
Rauru&#39;s Blessing
        

Located just outside the Hateno Village Research Lab, the Mayahisik Shrine is part of the quest line for getting a Shrine Sensor installed on Link&#39;s Purah Pad. Because of this, the shrine itself is virtually nothing. The quest will involve talking to NPCs and working to get the Shrine Sensor, but then it will lead to a pile of rocks that needs to be broken. Once the pile of rocks is destroyed, the Mayahisik Shrine is nothing but a chest. Despite being the conclusion of this quest line, this shrine could have had something for Link to do within it. Even a simple puzzle would be better than nothing.





 5  Kyononis Shrine 
Combat Training
        

Like the other Combat Training shrines in TOTK, the Kyononis Shrine is designed to teach Link combat skills. In this case, it focuses entirely on dodging. Again, there is a Zonai Construct in the middle of a room that is ready to attack Link and help him practice. Dodging, parrying, and attacking when told to do so is all that it takes to complete the challenge. Although the timing of these skills can be tricky to satisfy the Construct, it is otherwise a bit too narrow in focus on what could be done in a Combat Training arena.





 4  Zanmik Shrine 
Scoop It Out


 







The Zanmik Shrine in Zelda: TOTK is a bit of a tedious exercise. Link is encouraged to use the Ultrahand to build a scoop to attach to a spinning wheel that will carry large balls from a ball pit up to a spot on the level above. It is easier to simply attach a ball to the wheel, however, and then watch as the ball gets carried up to the top by the spinning wheel where it can then be detached. The concept is clever, but in a shrine that quite literally has a giant ball pit in it, there are so many missed opportunities.

 3  Mogisari Shrine 
Courage To Jump


 







Getting to the Mogisari Shrine is a challenge in itself, but once there, it is a fun chance to speed through a low-gravity track in a vehicle. The shrine consists of dodging Constructs and spikes and even driving over lava and lasers before it culminates in using rockets to jump off a massive ramp. It reminds many of Halo 3&#39;s Warthog Run and is a very fast and fun race that is over much too soon.

 2  Mayachin Shrine 
A Fixed Device
        

The Mayachin Shrine in Zelda: TOTK is known as the &#34;A Fixed Device&#34; puzzle and is somewhat like pinball and tee-ball combined to make a game. A large target is revealed that needs to be struck with a ball and is accomplished using Stakes to form a sort of pinball flipper-type object. It is fun to learn how to use the stakes and the puzzle is a rewarding game once solved, but none of its concepts are used again besides the two times Link does it in the shrine.





 1  Jochi-iu Shrine 
Courage To Pluck
        

For anyone who has played the real-world game Jenga, that is essentially all that the Jochi-iu Shrine in TOTK is. It is a fun puzzle, using Link&#39;s Ultrahand to pull blocks out of the tower and use them strategically. This is a perfect example of a puzzle that could have been made longer because it is a fun idea. There is a reason that Jenga is a popular game in real life, and getting to use the Ultrahand in this way is entertaining. The Jochi-iu Shrine simply needed to be longer and have more to do, and it could have been a lot of fun if it was a larger part of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
               The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom   Summary:   The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom is the anticipated follow-up to Breath of the Wild, released in 2017. A rare occurrence in Zelda titles, Tears of the Kingdom is a direct sequel instead of loosely connected. In Tears of the Kingdom, Link will take to the skies and learn about a mysterious kingdom in the clouds. Additionally, he will discover the secrets of the dark ones that dwell below and above the earth. The sequel is being built on the same engine as the original, with unique physics tools again being utilized. However, little about the plot and gameplay is known.
