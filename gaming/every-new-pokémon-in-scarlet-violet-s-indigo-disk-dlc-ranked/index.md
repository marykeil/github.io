## Literature Review

The new Pokémon in The Indigo Disk DLC are generally strong, but some come out ahead of others when all attributes are taken into consideration.




The Indigo Disk DLC introduces an array of new Pokémon to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, some of which are more likely to become common favorites than others. The concluding half of The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero takes trainers to Blueberry Academy, a unique school mostly located under the ocean. Thanks to a gigantic man-made Terarium, however, the school is able to house a variety of interesting creatures adapted to different biomes, and capturing them all is as interesting of a challenge as always.
The Indigo Disk is longer than the preceding The Teal Mask DLC, but it doesn&#39;t raise its ambition when it comes to new Pokémon, with the seven currently available additions matching the number fromThe Teal Mask. Quality matters more than quantity, however, so taking a look at what each Pokémon has to offer is a better indicator of value. The new Indigo Disk Pokémon cover a variety of types and inspirations, but they could all make for effective choices in battle if employed well.
            
 
 &#34;The Good Outweighs The Bad&#34; - Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC Review 
The Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet is an enjoyable addition, but it&#39;s bogged down by the same problems as the base games.












 








 7  Hydrapple Isn&#39;t Especially Strong 
Type: Grass/Dragon


 







Hydrapple has an especially charming design in The Indigo Disk, but it&#39;s hard to argue that this Pokémon is one of the most effective among the new introductions. This evolution of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet&#39;s Dipplin has the lowest total base stats of any new The Indigo Disk Pokémon, and the overall arrangement of those numbers isn&#39;t a particularly favorable one either, with a slow speed and low special defense being especially concerning. That being said, Hydrapple&#39;s new move Fickle Beam can be a lot of fun, so there can still be a reason to have Hydrapple on a team beyond its memorable appearance.





 6  Raging Bolt Has A Fun Signature Move 
Type: Electric/Dragon
        

On the flip side of designs, there&#39;s Raging Bolt, a version-exclusive Indigo Disk Pokémon that&#39;s been subject to a lot of jokes since well before the actual release of the DLC. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t have a truly incredible stat array to offset its overall goofiness, but it&#39;s still a good Pokémon in general. The signature move Thunderclap is an interesting one, with a &#43;1 priority that gets ahead of an enemy&#39;s physical or special attack. If they haven&#39;t, however, the attack will fail, making it a bit of a risk in battle.





 5  Iron Boulder Is Mainly Offensive 
Type: Rock/Psychic
        

Iron Boulder has some strong offensive abilities in The Indigo Disk DLC, with a high speed and a signature move called Mighty Cleave that can override Protect from an opponent. Everything relies on getting rid of opposing Pokémon quickly, however, with a general lack of the defensive power that the name Iron Boulder might imply. The biggest problem is a weakness to 7 types, outweighing the resistance to 5 and making Iron Boulder a gamble depending on what Pokémon it&#39;s facing.





 4  Gouging Fire Is Hard To Take Down 
Type: Fire/Dragon
        

Unlike Iron Boulder, Gouging Fire doesn&#39;t have any hugely critical weak points. Fairly strong defense and solid attack mean it can hold its own in most battles, but things really get interesting with the signature move Burning Bulwark. This acts as a general Protect ability, which is powerful enough in its own right, but it also burns attackers who would have otherwise made contact. This can be especially useful in the double battles that make up a large percentage of fights in The Indigo Disk, so Gouging Fire is very much in its element in the DLC.





 3  Archaludon&#39;s Base Stats Are Excellent 
Type: Steel/Dragon
        

Archaludon has a base stat total of 600, which is higher than any other non-legendary Pokémon in Scarlet and Violet. This includes high special attack, attack, and defense, making Archaludon particularly difficult to deal with in battle. Add a surplus of resistances and few weaknesses, and Archaludon is one of the best possible The Indigo Disk Pokémon to have on a team.
            
 
 Pokémon Indigo Disk DLC Full Pokédex: Every Pokémon Number &amp; Type 
Over 200 Pokémon compose the Blueberry Pokédex in the Indigo Disk DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Here are all of them, listed in order.



Archaludon&#39;s design is the type that&#39;s likely to be divisive among fans of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, as it&#39;s fundamentally silly in the way that sometimes splits the community. Most of the time, Archaludon looks something like a staple remover, but laying itself out for a move like Electro Shot reveals that the Pokémon can look entirely identical to a suspension bridge. It&#39;s an unusual design choice for a Dragon-type, but making fun of Archaludon to its face would probably be a very bad idea.





 2  Iron Crown Has Strong Resistances 
Type: Steel/Psychic


 







Iron Crown generally takes the middle road on stats, managing a rock-solid performance in just about every category. The Steel/Psychic-type&#39;s attack isn&#39;t great, but good special attack and solid defense basically cover things. Resistance to 10 types against weakness to 4 makes it difficult to get a good edge against Iron Crown, which can quickly become a problem considering how good the Pokémon&#39;s moveset is. The signature move Tachyon Cutter always hits twice as long as the opponent is physically there, quickly dealing major damage and making catching Iron Crown in The Indigo DIsk DLC a major priority.





 1  Terapagos Makes Major Use Of Terastallization 
Type: Normal


 







Terapagos might not seem like much in its normal form, but it turns out that those basic stats are never actually relevant. Terapagos uses Tera Shift to enter the Terastal form in battle, which makes the Pokémon significantly more effective and makes damage-dealing moves weak while it&#39;s at full health. Even that, however, isn&#39;t the peak of its powers, as using the Terastallize mechanic further transforms Terapagos into its Stellar form.
Stellar Terapagos can only come out to play once per Pokémon center trip, but Terapagos is the best in the game whenever this climactic level of power is unleashed. This unlocks the highest base stats of any Pokémon that can be caught in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, with excellent health and special attack in particular. A 1.2x multiplier also boosts the efficacy of moves outside of the Normal type, and weather and terrain effects are immediately cleared. There&#39;s a reason that Terapagos is the mascot of The Indigo Disk DLC, and this exceptional Pokémon makes for a strong grand finale to the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet DLC.
