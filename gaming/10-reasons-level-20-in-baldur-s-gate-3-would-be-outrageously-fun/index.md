## Literature Review

Baldur’s Gate 3 has a strict level cap of 12, mostly because D&amp;D characters become overpowered when they hit level 20. Here are a few reasons why.




There are many reasons why Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 sets a strict level cap at 12. There may not be much difference between 12 and 13, but in the upper levels of the Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules it&#39;s based on, things get a little out of hand. Starting around level 18, characters are able to cast all-powerful spells, and they begin to take on incredible class features that remove all restrictions on their abilities. It&#39;d be a nightmare for game balance, to say the least, but some of the complex varieties of high-level spells would also be impossible to program into a video game.
Forget boss cheesing strategies, game-breaking exploits, and overpowered spells in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3. Accommodation for characters up to level 20 would make almost every combat encounter a joke. But with level 20 abilities in the party&#39;s arsenal, they&#39;d also be a lot of fun. Here are 10 of the best high-level DnD abilities that would make level 20 a devastating delight.
            
 
 One Easily Missed Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 Mechanic Will Have Companions Camping In Style 
There are many mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3 that are not evidently explained. Here is one that may make your camping sessions more pleasant.












 








 10  Infinite Wild Shape Charges 
And Beast Spells For BG3 Druids


 







At level 20, DnD druids gain the class feature Archdruid. This removes the limit on their Wild Shape charges; while they could previously only take animal form twice per short rest, at level 20, they can do so as many times as they want. Between the ability-changing versatility of the coolest Wild Shape forms in BG3 and the bottomless pool of temporary HP, its utility is obvious. The feature Beast Spells allows druids to cast certain spells while transformed at level 18, and it&#39;s further at level 20 to include all spells. Therefore, level 20 druids never need to choose between their Wild Shape benefits or their spells.





 9  Infinite Rage Charges 
For BG3 Barbarians
        

Just as druids get endless charges of their main class feature at level 20, so do barbarians. Level 20 Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 barbarians would be able to Rage as often as they wanted. The benefits of Rage vary by subclass, but would make any and all level 20 barbarians into unstoppable, multi-attacking powerhouses. There&#39;s some basis for high-level Wild Magic and Berserker class features in DnD. Berserkers get a retaliative strike as a reaction, and Wild Magic barbarians gain more control over their surges. But it&#39;d be interesting to see how Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 develops the Wildheart subclass, which doesn&#39;t exist in the tabletop game, up to level 20.





 8  Near-Infinite Ki 
For BG3 Monks
        

Monks don&#39;t get as many charges of their main class feature as druids and barbarians, but at level 20, their Ki becomes near-infinite. Ki is effectively equivalent to a magically-inclined class&#39; spell slots, in that monks can expend it to use a wide variety of offensive and defensive abilities. At level 20, they have a pool of 20 Ki points to start with, and can recharge it partially each time they roll Initiative - in essence, at the beginning of every battle. This ensures monks never run out of Ki when they need it most, and can perform their most powerful battle maneuvers without worrying about running out of resources.





 7  Inevitable Divine Intervention 
For BG3 Clerics


 







Because of the differences between how Divine Intervention works in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 and DnD, it&#39;s difficult to say just how it&#39;d work at level 20. In DnD, Divine Intervention is usable once per in-game week, can have almost any effect at a DM&#39;s discretion, and requires a roll of the dice to succeed. Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 removes the dice roll, limits Divine Intervention to one of four effects, and allows each cleric to use it exactly once in the entire campaign. In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, level 20 might give clerics further charges of this all-powerful ability, or even expand its effects.





 6  Overpowered Sneak Attacks 
For BG3 Rogues


 







One of the most satisfying things possible in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 is the rogue&#39;s good old-fashioned sneak attack. It&#39;s already pretty powerful at lower levels, dealing an extra 1d6 damage to any enemy the rogue has Advantage over, or who&#39;s distracted by an ally. But at level 20, that damage bonus is increased to 6d10, dealing up to 60 damage before even accounting for weaknesses. That can kill lower-level foes in a single hit, and even on high-level targets, 60 damage is nothing to sneeze at.





 5  Plane Shift 
For BG3 Clerics, Sorcerers, Warlocks, Wizards, And Druids
        

Plane shift is a seventh level spell in DnD, allowing the caster to transport up to eight people instantly between planes of existence. This would greatly interrupt the story of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, which has the party visiting a very limited section of the Astral Plane only during certain hyperspecific story moments. However, this would have incredible implications for the speedrunning community. Using Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 exploits to jump to level 20, then teleporting to the Astral Plane to force a confrontation with the Emperor would allow players to skip enormous swaths of the game.





 4  Teleport 
For BG3 Bards, Sorcerers, And Wizards
        

Teleport is like a powered-up version of misty step in DnD, instantly transporting its targets from point A to point B. But where misty step only works on the caster, and has a range of 30 feet, teleport can be applied to up to eight targets, and transport them to any destination they&#39;ve already visited. In Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, this would be the ultimate evolution in fast travel. It might even be usable for Act-hopping, returning to earlier maps even after passing the point of no return. Since the DnD spell involves a degree of randomness, this could create chaos by inserting the party into an encounter they skipped earlier.





 3  True Polymorph 
For BG3 Bards, Warlocks, And Wizards
        

Polymorph is useful in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 because of its ability to transform omnipotent foes into docile prey animals. The primary difference between the two is that if the caster concentrates on true polymorph for the full duration of one hour, the transformation becomes permanent. This is great for sowing chaos: imagine turning the whole of Baldur&#39;s Gate into a city of sheep. But it could also be used to basically bypass boss encounters. Concentrate on turning Raphael into a sheep the first time the party meets him, and he&#39;ll probably fall in a single hit during the final encounter.





 2  Power Word Kill 
For BG3 Bards, Sorcerers, Warlocks, And Wizards
        

Power word kill is infamous in DnD as the one-hit kill spell. It doesn&#39;t get much more complicated than that, except that DnD does impose a strict limit of 100 hit points; anything over that, and the spell has no effect. With power word kill prepared, there would be no such thing as low-level enemies. Each of them would be dispatched with a single spell. This would make some of the hardest bosses in Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 much easier - not because it&#39;d kill them directly, but because it&#39;d take out their minions.





 1  Wish 
For BG3 Sorcerers And Wizards
        

Wish is described in DnD sourcebooks as the most powerful spell that can be cast by a single, mortal being. It has a wide variety of uses, but wish can primarily be employed to imitate the effects of a lower-level spell without any of the requirements. It can also be used to summon high-value items, instantly and fully heal the entire party, or even force a reroll of any unfavorable result in the current round of combat. In fact, wish can be used for almost anything, almost like a catch-all cheat code that would carry the party through the difficult final chapters of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3.
These are just a few of the class features and spells that would liven up a campaign through level 20. There are certainly more overpowered eighth- and ninth-level spells that BG3 could draw from, and high-level class features that make every kind of character unstoppable. While most of these will probably never make it into Baldur&#39;s Gate 3, it&#39;d be nice to see an allowance for just a few more levels in future DLC.
