## Literature Review

Even though Version 4.5 is still a ways away from arriving, there are already leaks regarding the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact.




A set of new Genshin Impact 4.5 leaks has allegedly revealed some of the characters that are intended to be featured during the upcoming update. While Version 4.4 is still on its way, with several leaks of its own surrounding its impending release, the next, some details concerning Version 4.5 are starting to arise. At the moment, the vast majority of the leaks revolve around the next update, however. There have been Genshin Impact 4.4 skin leaks, for instance, as well as mentions of an unexpected extension to a well-beloved region of Teyvat. There have even been hints at a new deity inhabiting such an area.




The most notable pieces of information, nevertheless, concern the new character. Cloud Retainer’s release in Genshin Impact 4.4 has even been confirmed by developer HoYoverse following a series of leaks. There are also some alleged details about her gameplay kit, though that has not been officially detailed. Leaked information usually comes from playtesters with early access to the content. While Version 4.4 is still on the way, expected to be released on January 31 according to the regular six-week schedule, there are already a few leaks about Version 4.5, and they mention not only another new playable character but also a long-awaited character banner rerun.

                  Genshin Impact 4.4 Leaks: The Best Region Is Getting Even Bigger   It seems like the best region in Genshin Impact may be getting an extension in Version 4.4. Here is what this could mean for the story.   


 Chiori May Debut In Genshin Impact 4.5 Along With An Albedo Rerun 
         




According to a post made by a well-known leaker called Little Teyvat, later reposted by user Stellar Monarch on Reddit, two of the playable characters featured in Genshin Impact 4.5 will be Chiori and Albedo. Chiori made her debut as an NPC during Version 4.3’s flagship event, named “Roses and Muskets”. There are no mentions of Chiori’s rarity in the leak shared by Little Teyvat, though her name being mentioned alongside Albedo seems to suggest that she may be of equal importance. Albedo, on the other hand, has been a playable 5-star hero since his release back in December 2020. Since then, Albedo has been featured in two banner reruns.



As is the case with any leak regarding Genshin Impact, the information should be taken with a grain of salt. The leaks may be subject to change ahead of the update’s release or outright incorrect.






 Who Is Chiori In Genshin Impact 4.5? 
          




Chiori has been mentioned by name several times over the campaign. The character is a fashion designer from the region of Inazuma and is the owner of Chioriya Boutique store in Fontaine. She currently resides in the Nation of Hydro due to its affinity to fashion. Chiori is also said to be a customer of the Komaniya Express, for which Kirara is known to work for. In fact, during the flagship “Roses and Muskets” event in Genshin Impact 4.3, Chiori revealed that she designed Kirara’s outfit for free, as a way of allowing Kirara to change clothes, as well as showing off her style and brand of tailoring.

With her debut as an NPC in the Version 4.3 event, it was confirmed that Chiori is in possession of a Geo Vision. Although that is not actively mentioned, the Vision is visible dangling on the right side of her kimono’s obi belt. Her weapon of choice and her future role in team comps, however, have not been officially revealed. As reported by Sportskeeda, however, there are rumors about her being a sword user and operating as a support unit. Some speculation hints at Chiori having her Talents scale off her Defense stat. There are also rumors about her gameplay focus revolving around increasing the strength of shields through Crystallize.




As was pointed out by Sportskeeda, this may go well with the recently released Navia in Genshin Impact. Navia is a Geo DPS who gains power from the triggering of Crystallize reactions and usage of Geo Shards, so having a support unit like Chiori helping Crystallize occur and making the shields even stronger seems like a perfect match with the president of the Spina di Rosula. The leaked information about Chiori’s abilities is still scarce, however, so players should wait for official confirmation by HoYoverse before creating any hopes and expectations around the character’s usefulness on the field and in Geo-based team comps.



 Albedo’s Rerun In Genshin Impact Is Pending Since 2022 
          

Although Chiori’s potential release in Genshin Impact 4.5 is exciting news, Albedo’s rerun is equally enticing information. If the leaks are accurate and Albedo does, in fact, rerun in Version 4.5, this will end the year-long streak of his absence from banners. Albedo was released over three years ago and has only been featured in two rerun banners – the last of which was in October 2022. Since then, players have not had a chance to pull for the 5-star Geo unit. Unlike more recent 5-star characters, Albedo does not have a signature 5-star weapon. Instead, his best weapon is the 4-star event-exclusive Cinnabar Spindle, which cannot be obtained anymore.




                  Genshin Impact: System Requirements For PC &amp; Mobile   The system requirements to run Genshin Impact on PC and mobile devices are surprisingly not demanding. This is what you need for each platform.   

Albedo is not among the best characters in the game, but he is one of the top Geo units to have, as his presence as a sub-DPS can significantly improve the performance of some team comps. Paired up with characters such as Navia and Arataki Itto in Genshin Impact, Albedo can be of great help, especially because he can constantly and consistently deal Geo damage while he is off the field. His rerun in the same version as Chiori would be a great way of pushing for more Geo presence in the meta of the game, which is still quite absent, despite Navia’s recent release.



If the scarce details about Chiori’s kit are true, then pairing her up with Albedo as a sub-DPS and a Geo DPS like Navia could make for some of the strongest team comps in the game.







Of course, Chiori and Albedo’s character banners in Version 4.5 are only two of the four regular heroes featured in every update. That leaves two 5-star slots to fill, if Chiori is, indeed, a new 5-star character. Nevertheless, the leaks regarding Version 4.5 should get more abundant and reliable as the update itself approaches. While Version 4.4 is not released, it is best to take any 4.5 leaks with extra caution, as banner arrangements are commonly changed in Genshin Impact, which often leads to some surprise for those who were considering leaks as the absolute truth.
