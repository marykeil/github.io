## Literature Review

Cyberpunk 2077 includes a secret version of Batman&#39;s car, and this guide will show you exactly where the Batmobile (Rayfield Caliburn) is located.





Predictably, the car isn&#39;t called the &#34;Batmobile&#34; in the game but is known as the Rayfield Caliburn instead. To get access to this car, you will be required to use a motorbike as the cave is quite narrow and makes it quite challenging for other vehicles to clear it.




                  Cyberpunk 2077: All Free Car and Vehicle Locations   Cyberpunk 2077 lets players drive through Night City in tons of different vehicles. A lot of them pricey, but there are plenty of free cars to find.

Once you&#39;re inside the cave, you can use the precise map location above to find the container within the cave. You will also find a legendary T-shirt and a shard inside the cave. You only need to enter the car to collect the legendary Batmobile. While this car can be acquired for free, you should not ignore its capabilities. The Rayfield Caliburn is one of the fastest cars in Cyberpunk 2077.

It&#39;s unclear just how much inspiration Cyberpunk 2077 took from the Dark Knight, but driving around in Batman&#39;s car while Keanu Reeves does his best impersonation of the Joker from Arkham City sure feels like some parallel universes are colliding. The game is full of references to other media and franchises, from Hideo Kojima to CD Projekt Red&#39;s own Witcher series. Because of this, driving around in Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Batmobile doesn&#39;t feel nearly as out of place as it could.
