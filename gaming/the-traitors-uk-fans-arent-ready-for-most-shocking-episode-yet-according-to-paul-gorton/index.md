## Literature Review

The Traitors UK season 2&#39;s treacherous Paul Gorton shared a tweet that led his fans into madness as he teased the upcoming episodes of the show.




The Traitors UK season 2’s Paul Gorton knows the season has been exciting already, but shared he feels fans won’t be expecting what happens next on the murder mystery competition series. While The Traitors UK’s season 2 has been off to a fascinating and intense beginning, the series still has its biggest twists to come. As the cast of Traitors have worked hard to keep their identities a secret, the rest of the players have been focused on finding out who they are and banishing them from the game. After getting Traitor Ash Bibi out of the castle, the Faithful have been on a run of banishing their own.




In response to a post on Twitter from Scott Bryan asking, “HOW IS IT STILL TWO DAYS TILL THE TRAITORS,” one of the Traitors themselves responded. Paul, who’s still part of the Traitors team along with Harry Clark, shared his thoughts on the tweet. “You’ll be thankful for the days off after you witness what’s coming,” Paul shared on his own account, creating chaos amongst his followers on the platform. While Paul is one of the remaining Traitors, it’s clear things will be exciting during the third week of competition as The Traitors UK season 2 cast continues to work.

For those who are up to date with the series, it’s no surprise that Paul was excited to share what happened in the most recent episode. During The Traitors UK season 2 episode 7, Paul was able to get one of his fellow Traitors banished, which took the heat off him a bit in the eyes of several other players in the game. While Paul and Harry were able to get rid of Miles Asteri, their road ahead will be a bumpy one.
