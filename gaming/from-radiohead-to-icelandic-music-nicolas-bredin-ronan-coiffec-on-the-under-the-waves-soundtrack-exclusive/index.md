 Nicolas Bredin and Ronan Coiffec On Under The Waves 
         

First, I would just love to talk a little bit about how the creative process starts for the soundtrack for a game like this. Did you always know how you wanted it to sound or was there a lot of evolution there?


Nicolas Bredin: I think it&#39;s a great question because I think that because we co-founded with Ronan, Parallel Studio, when we start a new project, we really start by thinking about everything, included audio and music, so it start very early in the process. And I think that we had a reflection together with Ronan that progress according what we imagined for the game.
So we start to speak with a global vision and to give an idea at the very early step of the development of Under the Waves. The mood was really a strong, very easy, and I changed the music direction to have something more lightly because we thought, with Ronan, that we must have something not too depressive for the visual for the music. So the music progressed with the idea that we want to illustrate with the game, with the story, not something too depressive.
Ronan Coiffec: Yeah, I said that at the beginning of the game, we really decided to create a strong sound direction, music direction, but we have also decided to create rock band music added to the game. So we really start with that idea to have two contrastive kinds of music.
Nicolas Bredin: Yeah, it&#39;s exactly that. The idea, despite what I talk about, about the evolution of the mood of the music, was to combine music that could be listened like an album. Because an album narrates the story, it was the idea to mix different style of music and to have something equivalent at the end in the post-rock album and to - it&#39;s very difficult to explain, really, the global idea, but it was really that music that can be listened alone that narrates a story that is the story of the video game.
Ronan Coiffec: Yeah, I think it&#39;s good.
Nicolas Bredin: It could be a little bit blah to explain like that, but at the end it was to mix different styles. Of course the idea that we have of narrative music like in a movie, a video game, but to include music that we can have in an album of a band, and it&#39;s really what we wanted, to mix these kinds of elements.
Ronan Coiffec: I think it&#39;s also a way to have something very cinematographic to add.





And I know that this soundtrack pulls influences from a lot of different places like post-rock and Icelandic music. Can you talk a little bit about the different places where you pulled inspiration from?


Nicolas Bredin: So for Hanging Fields, it&#39;s my band of music, I compose everything inside. And I think that the project of Hanging Fields is born with the early steps of Under the Waves. So it&#39;s very particular, because it&#39;s independent of Parallel Studio, but the composition of Hanging Fields, it&#39;s very relatively linked to what we like to narrate with Parallel Studio.
I think that after the influences it&#39;s very - I like simple music that illustrates, narrate something. And I think that I&#39;m very influenced by that with simple melody to explain something that will directly touch the listener. And it&#39;s for that I like Max Richter, Ólafur Arnalds, this kind of very narrative music that narrates something without images. It&#39;s the images that we can have in the head. And of course because it&#39;s music, it depends of the listener, but I like to find simple melody. For example, for EQQO, we recorded the music with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.
Ronan Coiffec: It was our previous project.
Nicolas Bredin: Yes. It was the same approach: simple melodies that can be very easily memorized. And I did, of course, harmonization because it was with orchestra. But I like this kind of music, not too much demonstrative that narrates something. And of course a contemporary composer like Ólafur Arnalds and Max Richter, Valgeir Sigurdsson, were a big influence for me. But for this game, in general, it&#39;s contemporary composers of the beginning of 20th century influenced me in my composition.
Ronan Coiffec: When we started to talk about the project with Nicolas, we also talked about more commercial influence, like Radiohead or Sigur Rós, that kind of melancholic post-rock music.
Nicolas Bredin: Radiohead was a big influence in term of approach of the composition, not really in the music but in the approach of the composition because they are very specific in their approach of tone and minor, major. And it&#39;s really what I use in the music of Under the Waves, this kind of harmonization. They&#39;re not totally major, not totally minor, and some things ambiguous. And so in the imagery that we can have of the music, it&#39;s something that&#39;s very ambiguous; not happy, not sad, something that can -
Ronan Coiffec: Melancholic?
Nicolas Bredin: Yes, melancholic. Ambiguous, yes.





Were there any specific moments or environments in the game that it was particularly difficult to get the soundtrack just right for?


Nicolas Bredin: Yeah.
Ronan Coiffec: The dreams and the ending, actually, because it was very difficult to - we had two choices. One of the choices was to be very music for the picture, like in the movie, or use the music from the band of Nicolas to create contrast. So we have tested a lot of things. And for me, actually, it was the main difficult part in the game.
Nicolas Bredin: Yeah. Personally, I would say that&#39;s the most difficult perhaps for me was to wait for Pearl theme. Because I think we made a very personal video game, and because it&#39;s my daughter that did the motion capture and because the character looks like my daughter, because the story is very strong and I think that for me, personally, the most difficult was to work on these kinds of sequences. Because in the video game, I recognize my daughter and I must compose a theme for her in the game.





          

And now with this being released on vinyl, I&#39;m curious how you think the listening experience with vinyl is perhaps different at all from listening with digital media instead?


Ronan Coiffec: I think for me, too, it will be about some grains. All the game is about a story placed in the late &#39;70s, so all this kind of sound of the kind of picture grain we take from the old documentaries we&#39;d seen when we were young, I think the value could fit really well the feeling we had in the game.
Nicolas Bredin: What can I add?
Ronan Coiffec: Maybe you can talk about the narrative side of the line, because Nicolas took a lot of time to really create the rhythm between each music to retell the story of the game through each part of the vinyl. So yeah, maybe it&#39;s a more narrative experience than the digital one.
Nicolas Bredin: Yeah, that&#39;s true. The main thing for me was to use analogics. It&#39;s easier to have this specific sound and I think to - because there is this one, the Moog and there is a lot on my table here. I think my approach to have the feeling that we want of &#39;90s, and something that matched with the visual was to use instrument that was used at this time, all the images that we have of the music at this time. So I combined analogical sound with a modern instrument to have a music that matched with the time of the story and with the mood that we want globally.





And I know that this physical release is being made through a BioVinyl process, which was the first time I had ever heard of that. I&#39;m curious to learn a little bit more about what that entails and how it sort of ties into the themes of your game.


Ronan Coiffec: Yeah, actually for us, it&#39;s also a big curiosity because it&#39;s quite new. And actually, the game is very ecological in the story and also in the way we&#39;ve done the game. For example, we&#39;ve also done the footprint of the studio during the game collection. So for us, it was very important to fit this meaning. And when we were asked about the BioVinyl, we would jump on that idea because it actually fits very well. But yeah, it&#39;s quite difficult today to have feedback on the final quality, et cetera, but it&#39;s a very good opportunity for us to express what we have in mind with this game.
Nicolas Bredin: Yes, perfect. It&#39;s really that it&#39;s something new so we hope that it&#39;ll work with the time for the BioVinyl.
Ronan Coiffec: Also the cover uses less of ink, for example. So the idea was to make something very ecological, to really fix the idea behind the game.





Awesome. And do you guys have a favorite part of the soundtrack, either because it&#39;s something that you&#39;re especially proud of or you just love listening to it yourself?


Ronan Coiffec: My favorite part is about the moon reveal, because it&#39;s very Vangelis-style music; I&#39;m a big fan of Vangelis. And also the ending because we made a very personal story. It&#39;s a very personal game. So yeah, for me it&#39;s the rock music, the post-music and the reveal of Moon of that kind of Vangelis feeling.
Nicolas Bredin: It&#39;s difficult for me, too.
Ronan Coiffec: Everything!
Nicolas Bredin: But I will say that the Stan theme, it&#39;s really the megamix of all the influences because there is the piano progression with Radiohead harmonization. There is a use of Moog and other analog synths. There&#39;s a use of guitar, but very transformed. Because in the game, I think that for all the themes, there are guitars, but very transformed to create a kind of music. And I think that Stan theme really mixes everything, the use of all the influences and all the instruments I use for the soundtrack. Perhaps I would say this one, yes.
