## Literature Review

Ark: Survival Ascended is a graphical revamp of Survival Evolved using UE5, but questions of what else has changed are worth exploring. 




Though Ark: Survival Ascended has the same core gameplay loop as Ark: Survival Evolved, there are some differences between the two titles. After all, though it has undergone a series of major updates and expansions since it was launched, Survival Evolved is now nearly a decade old, having been released in 2015. The multiplayer dinosaur survival game has remained wildly popular, and Ark: Survival Ascended updates the game to the much more powerful Unreal Engine 5 while including the expansions for Evolved, including Scorched Earth, Aberration, Extinction, and more.
Many have wondered what the major differences between the two titles are. In terms of core gameplay, the games are almost identical, but there are a few QoL enhancements and enough major changes that make Ascended better than Evolved in a few key ways. Though currently, there is only one island, and there have been issues with the title in its Early Access state — including crashes and bugs — these will hopefully be ironed out before the official release of the game.

 10  Ark: Survival Ascended Has Much Better Graphics 
Ascended Uses Unreal Engine 5


 







Ark: Survival Evolved runs on a custom version of Unreal Engine 4.5, which seriously limits the game&#39;s graphics and immersion. While it&#39;s still more than possible to create absolutely legendary monstrosities in Ark: Survival Ascended via the game&#39;s custom character creator, virtually every aspect of the game&#39;s visuals has been improved. Ark: Survival Ascended utilizes Unreal Engine 5, which makes textures, dinosaurs, and lighting look better.
The upcoming Ark 2 will also run on Unreal Engine 5. 






 9  In-Game Mods List 
Download New Dinos In The Main Menu


 







Many people enjoy the additional dinosaurs and other enhancements provided via mods, and Studio Wildcard took note of this by integrating a mod list directly into the game. In Ark: Survival Ascended, using mods is as easy as accessing a menu in the game rather than going through the Steam Workshop. This feature also enables people on Xbox and PlayStation consoles to utilize mods in their games.

 8  More Customizable Camera 
Zoom Has Been Added
        

While it is a minor feature, the fact that Ark: Survival Evolved has a fixed third-person camera limits visibility on the battlefield. This could cause serious issues in large conflicts, specifically when riding dinosaurs, as it limits the FOV for the character. Ark: Survival Ascended now comes with a zoom feature that gives people a wider view of the battlefield and the world around them.

 7  Streamlined Inventory Controls 
New Item Hotbar &amp; Fast Inventory
        

A new change that enables people to access their full inventory via the hotbar rather than manually entering the inventory screen is a much-welcomed changed in Ascended. People can now access several pages in their hotbar, which will help a lot with building, as different pieces can now be selected quickly. Similarly, shoulder pet inventories can now be accessed much more easily using the radial menu. These small QoL changes might not seem like much, but they will cut down on the time spent in inventory screens.





 6  Improved Map 
Waypoints And Coordinates
        

The map in Ark: Survival Ascended has seen a few updates. In addition to being able to keep it open while running around, there are more intuitive map controls. It&#39;s now possible to enter the map menu inside the inventory, zoom in and zoom out, and add custom map markers and waypoints. This will go a long way in helping people remember important locations.

 5  Changes With Building &amp; Construction 
Refunded Construction Materials
        

Something that many may have missed outside of those who enjoy building in Ark is a change to how resources are handled when supported structures are removed. Previously, the structures on top of the support would be destroyed, wasting all the resources put into building it. With the new change, resources are now put back into your inventory, making building feel a lot less risky overall. There are a few other minor QoL enhancements, too, like building pieces that snap to each other, making the overall experience a lot better.
Ark: Survival Ascended also introduces 15 new structures. 






 4  Cross-Platform Play And Official Servers 
Community Servers Are Also Enabled
        

Crossplay support for the new Ark: Survival Ascended means that people can now form tribes with each other across consoles, including PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. This, along with the introduction of official Ark servers, should streamline the experience for those just getting into the game and make it easier for people to play together regardless of their gaming setup.

 3  Big Changes To Crafting 
Wireless Crafting &amp; Tracking Resources
        

One minor QoL change that will go a long way in helping to reduce the amount of time spent in the inventory is the addition of an option within the inventory screen to track necessary resources used in crafting. Another massive change is an update to the Tek Dedicated Storage containers and the ability to craft items using the resources within them without manually taking them out. This wireless or remote crafting system will save a lot of time spent in the base.
It is now also possible to cook meat in a fireplace. 






 2  Quickly Switching Between Ammo Types 
Hold Reload For The Radial Menu
        

One of the more annoying mechanics in Ark: Survival Evolved was how the game handled switching between different ammo types. In Evolved, it&#39;s required to open the inventory, then click and drag the desired ammo into the required slot. While carrying two weapons with different ammo was a way to circumvent this, the ability to just change the ammo via the game&#39;s radial menu is a huge improvement. It will help people reload new ammo on the go and make combat feel more streamlined.
It&#39;s also possible to quickly add attachments to certain guns using the radial menu. 






 1  Big Changes To Irrigation And Generators 
Pipes &amp; Cables No Longer Needed


 







Pipes and cables are two somewhat complex and rather annoying building mechanics required for irrigation and power equipment in Ark: Survival Evolved. Luckily for most, Ark: Survival Ascended does away with the feature completely, instead opting for a much more streamlined way to build more complex structures. Now, people only need a water intake pipe from a water source for irrigation. This will create a radius around their base that is irrigated.
Similarly, cables are no longer needed to power a base. Instead, a generator will act much like a water intake pipe, creating a radius around the generator, which is all that&#39;s required to power structures. While it doesn&#39;t seem all that groundbreaking, this change will enable the construction of much more elaborate structures with way less effort in Ark: Survival Ascended and will help newer players or those who never liked the building elements to experiment with different builds.
