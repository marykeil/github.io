## Literature Review

The Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream is arriving soon, and will showcase all that is arriving in the upcoming patch for HoYoverse&#39;s popular RPG.




Although not officially announced, it is possible to predict the date and time of the Genshin Impact 4.3 livestream, as well as a portion of the content that will be presented during the event. As a live-service game, HoYoverse’s action RPG regularly receives patches – in fact, there is a six-week calendar for Genshin Impact updates – that add new bits of playable content. This includes story missions, limited-time events, debuting playable characters, quality-of-life system optimizations, and much more. Before the patches go live, however, the developer holds a special livestream that details parts of that upcoming content.




These livestreams show off the abilities of the new characters that were announced for that version, as well as peaks into the story content, and a preview of the limited-time events and the rewards that will be offered to players who participate. Navia’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact 4.3, for instance, should be confirmed (or debunked) during the special broadcast. The livestreams are also an opportunity for players to grab special and very limited promo codes that grant a few Primogems in Genshin Impact. This is the main currency used in buying Wishes, which are then utilized to acquire new playable characters and weapons.

 Date &amp; Time - Genshin Impact 4.3 Livestream 
          

Because Genshin Impact operates on a tight six-week schedule, it is possible to predict when the patch will arrive – and based on that information, it is possible to estimate when the livestream will occur. Because Version 4.2 was released on November 8, Version 4.3 is expected to arrive on December 20. Livestreams tend to happen two weeks prior, near the weekend, so the 4.3 livestream should occur on December 8. As confirmed in a post made on the official Genshin Impact account on X, the livestream will occur on December 8, at 7 AM EST. The broadcast will be held on the official Genshin Impact channel on Twitch.






The exact time and date of the 4.3 livestream will be updated once they are announced by HoYoverse.






 What To Expect From Genshin Impact 4.3 Livestream - New Characters &amp; Banners 
         

While the character banners will remain officially unknown until the livestream itself, there have been leaks showing precisely who arrives in the upcoming patch, as well as characters that rerun. According to a post made by a user on Reddit based on an alleged leak by Waffel, Phase 1 banners will feature Navia as a debut with Ayaka as a rerun. Navia has already been confirmed by HoYoverse as one of the upcoming characters in Genshin Impact 4.3. She is known to have a Geo Vision and be a claymore user, with leaks about her gameplay kit indicating she will operate as a main DPS.




Ayaka, on the other hand, is a 5-star Cryo swordswoman DPS. She is rerunning for the third time – Ayaka’s last rerun was in March. The Phase 2 banners of Genshin Impact 4.3, according to the leak, will be composed of Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya as the featured 5-star characters. Both of these are reruns, which means Version 4.3 will only see one 5-star debut. That does not mean Navia is the only new character. Chevreuse will make her debut as a 4-star character in the upcoming patch and signs point to her release in Phase 2 banners with the Electro Archon and the charismatic archer.

As seen in Chevreuse’s leaked gameplay kit in Genshin Impact, Chevreuse is a 4-star Pyro unit who uses a polearm in battle. She is expected to be a support unit for the team, offering healing to the party. What makes her different, however, is how she benefits from teams that trigger Overloaded Elemental Reactions. Leaks say she can deal more damage when the team uses Overloaded and is capable of providing buffs to Pyro and Electro units in the team.






Because of Raiden Shogun and Yoimiya’s alleged reruns in Phase 2, it is expected that Chevreuse be present in their banners, due to her synergy with characters that use Electro and Pyro, respectively.




Previous Genshin Impact 4.3 character banner leaks indicated that Albedo and Arataki Itto would rerun instead of Ayaka Kamisato and Yoimiya, but the leaks regarding Chevreuse and her kit make a solid case, at least for Yoimiya. While Navia’s release is almost certain for the upcoming patch, the leaks regarding reruns should be taken with a grain of salt, as they could be wrong or subject to change ahead of the update’s release.



 What To Expect From Genshin Impact 4.3 Livestream - Story Updates, Events, &amp; More 
          

When it comes to story updates, it does seem like Version 4.3 will slow down a bit. In the 4.0 livestream, HoYoverse announced that there would be Archon Quests from Version 4.0 through Version 4.2, and that promise has been fulfilled. There will be more Archon Quests in the future, but the major Fontaine storyline has come to a conclusion with the missions introduced in Version 4.2. Players faced the first weekly boss in Fontaine, encountered Skirk, and started to get ready to move to Natlan. While Natlan’s release in Genshin Impact should only happen in 2024, the most important narrative arc in Fontaine has concluded.






It is expected that new Archon Quests in Fontaine will be introduced later, around Version 4.5 or 4.6 – Sumeru saw new Archon Quests and the weekly boss Guardian of Apep’s Oasis in Version 3.6, for instance.




As such, Version 4.3 should be a period where the focus is on alternative side quests and limited-time events. According to Game Rant, a special event in the upcoming patch will be called “Guns and Roses” and will center around Navia and a story about the new 5-star Geo character in Genshin Impact. The flagship event, according to another post on Reddit, seems to indicate that there will be a crossover between Fontaine and Inazuma, with several featured characters from both Nations. If the map of Fontaine is expanded with new areas, the livestream will also showcase this. So far, there have been no reliable leaks regarding new areas, however.

So far, little details are known about the contents of the upcoming patch, such as the rewards for these events other than Primogems, Ascension, and Talent materials. It is also impossible to determine exactly what characters will rerun in banners given the various sources of information, but players can certainly expect Navia and Chevreuse to arrive, as they have already been officially announced – even if their leaked gameplay kits have not yet been confirmed. Genshin Impact 4.3 is a few weeks away, but there is already content to look forward to with the release of two new heroes and the future expansion of Fontaine.
