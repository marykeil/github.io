# Who Cyberpunk 2077s Best Ripperdoc Is (&amp; Where To Find Them)


## SUMMARY 



  Cyberware is essential in Cyberpunk 2077, providing V with a wide variety of new abilities and upgrades.   Ripperdocs can be found all throughout Night City, but following Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.0 update, there&#39;s no ripperdoc that is clearly the best.   Purchasable cyberware now scales with V&#39;s level, and only the Dogtown ripperdocs have exclusive inventory since they&#39;re only available in Phantom Liberty.

## Literature Review

Wasting time hopping from clinic to clinic isn&#39;t necessary in Cyberpunk 2077, as the gameâ€™s 2.0 update fundamentally changed cyberware inventories.




Every good edgerunner will need to augment their body with cyberware implants - and going to the best ripperdoc in Cyberpunk 2077 will ensure that they get the most powerful gear. Since the release of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s 2.0 update, which was quickly followed by the Phantom Liberty expansion, the question of which ripperdoc to see has been greatly simplified. V will no longer have to run all over Night City looking for the best chrome, but such convenience comes at a slight cost to verisimilitude.




Cyberware is not only important to V, but to Night City and the Cyberpunk setting as a whole. In 2077, life practically revolves around cybernetic implants, which can modify and enhance just about every part of the body, albeit with the risk of causing cyberpsychosis should too much cyberware be installed at once. Prior to Cyberpunk 2077 2.0, the ripperdoc in Downtown Night City could safely be considered the best in the game, owing to the sheer variety they offered. The question of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s best ripperdoc now, however, isn&#39;t so clear-cut.

 Cyberpunk 2077 Doesn&#39;t Have A Best Ripperdoc 
          




One of the fundamental changes made in Cyberpunk 2077 2.0 seemingly leveled the playing field when it comes to the ripperdoc market. Every ripperdoc in Night City now carries the same items, meaning it doesn&#39;t really matter where V goes to get cyberware installed; there is no best ripperdoc in Cyberpunk 2077. The only exception to this are the Dogtown ripperdocs, who offer new cyberware exclusively to those who have Phantom Liberty installed. These changes sadly take some of the personality away from Night City&#39;s ripperdocs, but it&#39;s ultimately more convenient for players.



 How To Get The Best Cyberware From Ripperdocs In Cyberpunk 2077 
          

With the introduction of Cyberpunk 2077 2.0, purchasable cyberware scales with V&#39;s level, it is no longer tied to V&#39;s Street Cred. Essentially, as players progress further through the game, ripperdocs will offer better items. Inventory is still random, however, so players may have to wait an in-game day for stock to refresh if looking for something specific. For some characters, a more convenient and cost-effective route will be to buy lower-tier cyberware and make upgrades along the way. This will likely be especially helpful for specializing builds focusing on the Technical Ability skill tree, where the Chipware Connoisseur perk, for instance, lets players choose specific stat modifiers when upgrading cyberware.




                  Cyberpunk 2077: Best New Perks To Unlock (Phantom Liberty DLC)   With the arrival of Cyberpunk 2077&#39;s Phantom Liberty expansion and 2.0 update, Perks have received a big overhaul. Here are the best Perks to use.    

While the ease of purchasing cyberware after the 2.0 update is nice from a gameplay standpoint, it&#39;s a bit disheartening to see the ripperdocs in Cyberpunk 2077 stripped of their unique inventories, especially considering how competitively capitalist the game&#39;s setting is. On the plus side, players may not have any more qualms about killing Fingers in retribution for the downtrodden patients he&#39;s taken advantage of, as he no longer offers exclusive cyberware to those who show restraint. Regardless, there&#39;s no longer a best ripperdoc in Cyberpunk 2077, so players are free to choose whichever clinic is most convenient.
